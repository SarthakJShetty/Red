Beaver populations were severely reduced in most countries by mediæval times, but the species clung on in marshes and other inaccessible places until the advent of efficient steel traps and accurate firearms in the 17th century; and then through to the 19th century there was a rash of final extinctions for these reasons combined with drainage of many of the large marshland areas in which the species clung on (all of the European refugia where the species survived, except in Norway, are extensive marshlands). Today, beaver populations in Europe are expanding rapidly, and there are no major threats (e.g. threats of a magnitude likely to cause decline at the regional level). Competitive exclusion of the native Eurasian Beaver C. fiber by its American cousin C. canadensis may be a threat in parts of Finland and north-west Russia, but it is not a major threat regionally. In Europe North American beavers are now confined entirely to Finland and north-west Russia, where populations are increasing only slowly (due to heavy harvesting). The former population at a reservoir near Paris has been removed, and populations introduced to Poland and Austria have apparently gone extinct in competition with C. fiber, the opposite of what has tended to happen in Finland and north-west Russia (it has been suggested that, due to differences in the life history of the two species, Eurasian beavers may have a competitive advantage at more southerly latitudes, whilst North American beavers may be more successful further north: D. Halley pers. comm. 2006). There are no serious prospects of further introductions (Halley and Rosell 2002, D. Halley pers. comm. 2006). The two species do not interbreed (Tattersall 1999). Road kill is an important source of mortality for some populations (Tattersall 1999). Rapidly expanding beaver populations may come into conflict with humans in some areas, as they do some damage to forestry and crops. Such damages should be put into perspective: they tend to be less severe than those caused by other species such as deer and voles, but are noticed because beavers are a new and unfamiliar species in areas where they have been recently introduced (Halley and Rosell 2002).In Mongolia, illegal hunting for skins, meat and castoreum still occurs in some areas such as the Tes River. Habitat loss through selective clear-cutting of willow, upon which this species relies for food and shelter is also a threat; this is known to be occurring along the Bulgan River and is leading to isolation of small populations and inbreeding. Pollution of water systems is also a threat. A hydroelectric dam in the Chinese section of the Bulgan River prevents migrations in this area (M. Stubbe pers. comm).In China, firewood gathering has depleted much of the forest on which the beavers need to subsist; additionally heavy grazing pressure has further reduced vegetation needed by beavers.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0

Most recently threats include non-target mortality from trapping and poisoning (there is a long-standing concern that quolls are being killed by the use of 1080 poisoning, but this has not been confirmed and is currently the focus of a number of investigative trials). Direct persecution is significant as they are attracted to caged birds and do not necessarily take flight when discovered. Estimated forest loss as a result of clearing within its former range in south-east Queensland is over 70%, with the majority of loss occurring over the last 20 years. The species uses a large number of den sites throughout the year and activities that reduce the number of den logs are likely to be significant. In Tasmania this taxon is naturally rare, possibly as a result of competition with D. viverrinus, Sarcophilus harrisii, and feral cats (Jones 1995). Road mortality could be a significant factor where high speed roads and good habitat coincide, as quolls are attracted to feed on the carcasses of road-killed animals (Maxwell et al. 1996).Dasyurus m. gracilis is susceptible to factors which increase juvenile and/or adult mortality, or which otherwise decrease breeding success. Such factors may include habitat clearance, logging, introduced species including cane toad, and direct killing at chicken pens, at houses, and on roads (Maxwell et al. 1996).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Esmaeili pers. comm. 2013, N. Shah pers. comm. 2014, N. Khudaykuliyev pers. comm. 2014, Feh et al. 2002). Other threats are habitat loss as a result of human settlement and cultivation, overgrazing and degradation, and limited access to open water sources (the mere presence of people and their livestock at water points can limit or block access for wild ass; Denzau and Denzau 1999, Kaczensky et al. 2006, Kaczensky et al. 2010).Of increasing concern is the continued habitat fragmentation by linear infrastructure development projects (mostly roads and railways) associated with the booming extractive industry in Mongolia and China. Asiatic Wild Asses are unable to cross fences (e.g. along the border between Mongolia and China or Iran and Turkmenistan, or fenced transportation corridors like the Ulaanbaatar-Beijing railway), have long flight distances from vehicles in areas with a high poaching pressure, and suffer from vehicle collisions (e.g., from 2009-2013, 26 Wild Asses were killed by traffic in Israel; Waner 2014). If not mitigated, fenced and/or high volume traffic corridors can be expected to create serious movement barriers (Batsaikhan et al. 2014).Wild Asses have become largely confined to semi-desert and desert areas with a high variability in water and pasture availability. To cope with this unpredictable environment and track the scarce resources available, Wild Asses need to have access to large tracts of land. This is particularly true in times of weather extremes, when Wild Asses need to outrun summer droughts or extreme winters (Kaczensky et al. 2011b). Although protected areas may provide important refuges, long-term conservation of Wild Asses will have to happen on the landscape scale. New planning tools are needed, like the “planning for a moving target” approach suggested for Saiga (Saiga tatarica) in Kazakhstan (Singh et al. 2011, Bull et al. 2013).Small, isolated populations are demographically and genetically vulnerable and prone to extinction, particularly in habitats with frequent environmental extremes (Kaczensky et al. 2011b, Saltz et al. 2006). Small and localised populations also have limited resilience to disease outbreaks or climate change. For example, a disease outbreak of African horse sickness in the 1960s resulted in a major decline and the extinction of small Khur populations (Gee 1963).Specific threats to particular populations are outlined below:The main threats to Khulan in Mongolia remain competition for water and pasture with livestock. The temporally high illegal offtake in Mongolia seems to have largely ceased, but could be resumed if the economic situation becomes unstable. Newly emerging threats are rapid infrastructure development particularly in connection with resource extraction industries (mining) that could result in barriers to migrations/nomadic movements (Batsaikhan et al. 2014) and habitat loss and degradation. The impacts of mining operation tapping into “ancient” aquifers on the active ground water table are not fully understood. The situation is complicated by a lack of capacity and funding to implement landscape scale planning and conservation. Furthermore, an estimated 60,0000 illegal “ninja” miners are degrading the habitat, polluting water sources and causing huge disturbance, though initiatives are under way transforming ninja mining into a formal sub-sector and developing mercury free processing techniques.Threats in northern China stem from intensified resource extraction which already resulted in the de-gazetting of parts of Kalamaili Nature Reserve, fencing and competition with local herders and their livestock (Xia et al. 2014). The situation in Gansu province is data deficient and potentially Wild Asses no longer occur in that region. The situation in Inner Mongolia is also unclear, the fence along the international border with Mongolia currently inhibits population exchange between the two countries.Threats to Khur in the Little Rann of Kutch in India stem from increasing human activities. Land use patterns have changed since the Mega Narmada Dam Project which resulted in the Sardar Sarovar canals all around the protected area (Goyal et al. 1999). Uninformed release of Sardar Sarovar canal excess waters into the Rann is having an impact on the micro-habitat, the short grasslands and is restricting the movement of Khur and other species across the saline desert. Increased agricultural practices have converted fallow lands into irrigation fields, resulting in shrinking habitat for the existing Khur population. Religious activities, cattle breeding and influx of people have accelerated on the Islands or Bets of the Rann. Prosopis juliflora invasion is an additional threat to the habitat. An estimated 30-35% of the Khur population lives outside the protected area and human-Khur conflicts are increasing, particularly crop raiding. In recent years Khur have also been increasingly hit on the major express highway. The International Boundary with Pakistan has been fenced thus restricting any possibility of Khur movement beyond borders. Although the population has somewhat increased over the past years, foaling rates in Khur have been on the decline in recent years (N. Shah pers. comm. 2014). In Kazakhstan Kulan in Altyn Emel National Park are thriving, but are believed to have reached carrying capacity. Transfers to Andassay Sanctuary have been resumed, but the status and whereabouts of the reintroduced animals is largely unknown due to a lack of post-release management. Poaching still seems to be a threat outside of Altyn Emel National Park.In Iran upgrading the core zone of Bahram-e-Goor protected area to Qatrouiyeh National Park and providing water supplies and occasional hay resulted in an increase of the Onager population. In contrast, the large adjacent Bahram-e-Goor protected area seems to act as a sink for the population due to occupation of water sources and productive ranges by livestock coupled with insufficient capacity for ranger presence and patrolling. As a result, the Onager population is concentrated in Qatrouyeh national park, which is starting to show signs of high herbivory pressure from Onagers. In Touran protected area the distribution range and abundance of Onagers have been decreasing. Occupation of suitable Onager habitats by livestock, poaching (usually by chasing the animal by motorbike) and insufficient protection are the most important threats to the species in this reserve.The situation of Kulan in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan is largely data deficient. The accuracy of population estimates and the distribution range are unclear. The border fence with Iran and Afghanistan does not allow for cross-border movements to the south any more. The autochthonous population in the Badkhyz Strictly Protected Area is declining. Large parts of the Wild Ass population in Badkhyz leave the Strictly Protected Area in summer to access water sources like the Kuska or Islim rivers close to the Afghan border. Outside the protected area, competition with livestock and crop raiding leads to conflicts with the local population. Poaching remains a problem and harassment by shepherds and their dogs and overgrazing by livestock limits Kulan access to pastures and water outside the reserve (N. Khudaykuliyev pers. comm. 2014).The reintroduced wild ass population in Israel lives in an extremely arid environment prone to droughts and in summer there are only three permanent water sources (all artificial) within the current distribution area. Presently the major known mortality cause is Wild Ass vehicle collisions. Although population size has doubled since 1999, an increase in the probability of extreme events under the predicted climate change scenario may still make this population vulnerable to extinction as modelled by Saltz et al. (2006). Another simulation model, based on changes in allele frequencies, suggests that a strong polygynous mating system is leading to increased genetic drift (Renan et al. 2015).",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Overhunting (often by trapping), as well as predator-poisoning programs and resource extraction caused Wolverine populations to contract in the eastern and south-western portions of the species's historical range in North America since the early 1900s (Banci 1994).The Wolverine is potentially locally threatened by its fragmented distribution and presumed low genetic diversity, as well as by 'population control' hunting and other consequences of perceived conflicts with people resulting from depredation of livestock. While this species inhabits a zone that is particularly affected by climate change (Rosenzweig et al. 2007), habitat change is not fast enough to be considered a major threat to it in the next three generations. Ample forest and tundra with suitable prey stocks are available throughout much of its range. A low rate of human land-use expansion into this range increases the frequency of interaction people, notably in conflict over livestock depredation. Given the remoteness of these locations, tolerance of Wolverines taking livestock is low and in some areas 'population control' hunting is used as a proactive means to avoid loss of animals. In Norway, where almost 10,000 sheep are believed to be killed by Wolverines each summer, government committees have instituted annual harvest quotas in an effort to control livestock losses; however, these quotas may not be sustainable as they are set very high even in relation to the most liberal estimate of Wolverine population size, and it is unclear whether this hunt actually reduces the numbers of sheep and semi-domestic deer lost to predators. Wolverines are scarce in Europe today. Their continued survival is threatened because of their small and fragmented distribution, and the potential for their future survival may be weakened by the likelihood of low genetic diversity. Habitat loss per se is not a substantial threat. Large areas of Norway, Sweden and Finland are still covered by forests and mountains that offer a suitable prey base and habitat for Wolverine. These are not wilderness areas, and the species comes into conflict with a low, but crucial, number of human land uses. There are no large areas within Wolverine distribution with no livestock conflict potential. This results in a difficult situation for wildlife managers who are forced to try and balance Wolverine conservation against the conflicts with livestock. In Norway, farmers no longer use traditional sheep-herding methods that once deterred depredation, so Wolverines are often controlled in an effort to protect livestock. Poaching also occurs. In Russia, over-harvesting and declines in key prey species are threats.1 and 2. The Scandinavian and southern Norwegian populations are subject to illegal killings because of depredation conflicts (sheep, domestic reindeer). The scope of this is difficult to quantify. Furthermore Wolverines are sensitive to human disturbance (settlements, public and private roads, etc.) especially near their dens (May et al. 2006). Most people in Norway are settled in southern Norway.3. In the Swedish forest population/occurrence, high genetic similarity among individuals in the two areas indicates inbreeding, possibly including brother-sister matings (Hedmark 2006). Inbreeding depression and demographic stochasticity are therefore likely to be threats (Pimm et al. 1988). These forest dwelling Wolverines live outside the distribution of 'domestic' Reindeer, which form the most common prey for Wolverines further north (Landa et al. 1997). Establishment in the forest landscape is judged to be a way of reducing Wolverine conflict with the domestic Reindeer industry (Hedmark 2006).4. In the Finnish – Western Russian population, about half the Finnish population lives within the Reindeer management area in the north (Kojola 2005), in conflict with this industry (Landa et al. 2000a, 2000b) with associated illegal killings. The scope of this is unknown. The Russian economic depression during the 1990s is believed to have led to widespread poaching of ungulates, and to a reduction of the domestic reindeer herding industry through large calf/breeding losses. This is believed to have indirectly reduced the Wolverine’s numbers and distribution in the European and most human-populated part of Russia (Landa et al. 1997, 2000a, 2000b; Novikov 2005). In Russia the Wolverine is harvested for fur, apparently without harvest restrictions. Russia has not yet ratified the Bern Convention. 5. The Finnish western population is small and presumably isolated: it is likely that it will face inbreeding problems (Hedmark 2006) as well as being exposed to demographic stochasticity (Pimm et al. 1988). Inbreeding depression and demographic accidents are therefore main threats, especially because these forest-dwelling Wolverines live outside the distribution of semi domesticated reindeer.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Prior to settlement of North America by Europeans, otters were widespread among aquatic habitats throughout most of the continent (Hall 1981). Unregulated trapping and loss or degradation of aquatic habitats through filling of wetlands and development of coal, oil, gas, tanning, timber, and other industries resulted in extirpations or declines in otter populations in many areas (Toweill and Tabor 1982, Melquist and Dronkert 1987). Nilsson (1980) reviewed the status of otters in the United States and determined that populations were extirpated in 11 states and had experienced severe declines in nine other states. The most severe population declines occurred in interior regions where fewer aquatic habitats supported smaller fewer otter populations. Although the distribution of otters became reduced in some regions of southern Canada, the only province-wide extirpation occurred on Prince Edward Island (Polechla 1990). During the 1970s, improvements in natural resource management techniques coincided with increased concern about otter declines in North America (Endangered Species Scientific Authority 1978). Consequently, many wildlife management agencies developed strategies to restore or enhance otter populations, including the use of reintroduction projects (Ralls 1990, Serfass et al. 1993). Since 1976 over 4,000 otters have been reintroduced among 21 states. Also, 29 states and all Canadian provinces except Prince Edward Island have viable populations that sustain annual harvests. Annual harvest numbers of North American Otters are similar for Canada and the United States (Obbard 1987), with most pelts being used in the garment industry (Toweill and Tabor 1982). In the late 1970s, annual harvest in North America reached ca 50,000 pelts, for a value of US$3 million (Melquist and Dronkert 1987). Otters are incidentally harvested by traps set for Beavers (Toweill and Tabor 1982), and therefore management plans should consider both species simultaneously (Polechla 1990). While current harvest strategies do not pose a threat to maintaining otter populations, harvest may limit expansion of otter populations in some areas (Lariviére and Walton 1998). Oil spills present a localized threat to otter populations, especially in coastal areas. Water pollution and other degradation of aquatic and wetland habitats may limit distribution of otters and pose long-term threats if enforcement of water quality standards are not maintained and enforced. Acid drainage from coal mines is a persistent water quality problem in some areas that eliminates otter prey prevents thereby inhibits recolonization or expansion of otter populations. Recently, there has been discussion of the long-term genetic consequences of reintroduction projects on remnant otter populations (Serfass et al. 1998). Similarly, many perceived threats to otters such as pollution and habitat alterations have not been rigorously evaluated.The threat of disease to wild otter populations is poorly understood and has received little study (Serfass et al. 1995). Lontra canadensis may be victim of canine distemper (Harris 1968, Park 1971), rabies (Serfass et al. 1995), respiratory tract disease, and urinary infection (Hoover et al. 1984, Route and Peterson 1991). In addition, North American Otters can contract jaundice, hepatitis, feline panleucopenia, and pneumonia (Harris 1968). North American Otters host numerous endoparasites such as nematodes (Hoberg et al. 1997), cestodes (Greer 1955), trematodes (Hoover et al. 1984), the sporozoan Isopora (Hoover et al. 1984), and acanthocephalans (Hoberg et al. 1997, Hoover et al. 1984). Ectoparasites include ticks (Eley 1977, Serfass et al. 1992), sucking lice Latagophthirus rauschi (Kim and Emerson 1974), and the flea Oropsylla arctomys (Serfass et al. 1992).",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0

The important role played by human-induced mortality has two long-term implications. First, it makes it likely that, outside protected areas, African Wild Dogs may be unable to coexist with increasing human populations unless land use plans and other conservation actions are implemented. Second, African Wild Dog ranging behaviour leads to a very substantial ""edge effect"", even in large reserves. Simple geometry dictates that a reserve of 5,000 km² contains no point more than 40 km from its borders – a distance well within the range of distances travelled by a pack of African Wild Dogs in their usual ranging behaviour. Thus, from an African Wild Dog's perspective, a reserve of this size (fairly large by most standards) would be all edge. As human populations rise around reserve borders, the risks to African Wild Dogs venturing outside are also likely to increase. Under these conditions, only the very largest unfenced reserves will be able to provide any level of protection for African Wild Dogs. In South Africa, “predator proof” fencing around small reserves has proved reasonably effective at keeping dogs confined to the reserve, but such fencing is not 100% effective (Davies-Mostert et al. 2009) and is unlikely to be long-term beneficial for wildlife communities.Even in large, well-protected reserves, or in stable populations remaining largely independent of protected areas (as in northern Botswana), African Wild Dogs live at low population densities. Predation by Lions, and perhaps competition with Spotted Hyaenas, contribute to keeping African Wild Dog numbers below the level that their prey base could support. Such low population density brings its own problems. The largest areas contain only relatively small wild dog populations; for example, the Selous Game Reserve, with an area of 43,000 km² (about the size of Switzerland), is estimated to contain about 800 African Wild Dogs. Most reserves, and probably most African Wild Dog populations, are smaller. For example, the population in Niokolo-Koba National Park and buffer zones (about 25,000 km²) is likely to be not more than 50–100 dogs. Such small populations are vulnerable to extinction. ""Catastrophic"" events such as outbreaks of epidemic disease may drive them to extinction when larger populations have a greater probability of recovery – such an event seems to have led to the local extinction of the small African Wild Dog population in the Serengeti ecosystem on the Kenya-Tanzania border. Problems of small population size will be exacerbated if, as seems likely, small populations occur in small reserves or habitat patches.

Trapping can reduce lynx populations and can have the greatest impact when hare populations cyclically crash. In the 1980s, in response to concerns about over-harvest during the cyclic low of the lynx-hare cycle, Alaska and most Canadian provinces modifying seasons or bag limits to match harvest with lynx population levels and trends (Golden 1999, Mowat et al. 2000). In the early 1980s (1980-1984), an average of 35,669 Canada Lynx pelts were exported from the US and Canada during the cyclic high. By the late 1980s (1986-1989) the annual export of lynx averaged 7,360 pelts during the cyclic low. Exports have trended lower and fluctuated less severely since then, with annual exports from 2000-2006 averaging 15,387 pelts (UNEP-WCMC 2008). Historical information suggests that, despite minimal harvest controls for much of the last century, lynx-hare cycles have been largely stable in the northern part of their range and no permanent range decrease has been detected (Mowat et al. 2000, Poole 2003).In eastern Canada where lynx are protected, the primary threat is believed to be from interspecific competition from the eastern coyote, which expanded its range into eastern North America in the last few decades (Parker 2001). In southern Alberta, road density and the presence of Coyotes influenced lynx occupancy (Bayne et al. 2008). In the contiguous US, the primary threat to lynx is habitat loss or fragmentation. Maintaining connectivity with the abundant northern lynx population is considered essential for recovery of southern lynx populations (Ruediger et al. 2000, Nordstrom 2005,Walpole et al. 2012, Squires et al. 2013) especially with warmer climate (Hoving et al. 2005, Caroll 2005). Older multi-storied forest provide winter habitat for lynx and Snowshoe Hare (Koehler et al. 2008, Squires et al. 2010) in the western US fire frequency has increased four-fold in the western U.S. in boreal forests that supports lynx and this disturbance is expected to increase with warmer climate (Westerling et al. 2006) . However, young dense conifer forest also provides habitat for lynx and Snowshoe Hare, thus natural disturbance and logging practices that foster dense understoreys of conifers can benefit lynx and hares (Burdett 2008, Vashon et al. 2008, and Walpole et al. 2012). Climate change increases insect-related disturbance to boreal forests (Fleming et al. 2002, Logan et al. 2003).Interspecific competition from other predators whose populations have increased in recent decades may also affect lynx through direct mortality or competition (Bunnell et al. 2006, Bayne et al. 2008, Vashon et al. 2012, but see Kolbe et al. 2007). The USFWS concluded that trapping was not responsible for lower lynx numbers at the edge of their range (USFWS 2000). Since listed as threatened, only a few lynx are captured and die in traps or snares set for other furbearers (DelGiudice et al. 2007, Vashon et al. 2012). Although lynx have been killed on logging roads with lower traffic volumes and speeds (Vashon et al. 2012), roads with high traffic speed and volumes may result in more road mortalities (Moen et al. 2008). Although, hybridization with bobcats has been found by genetic analysis in Minnesota, Maine, and New Brunswick (Schwartz et al. 2003, Homyack et al. 2008), hybridization does not appear to threaten southern lynx populations (Homyack et al. 2008).",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

In Thailand, the otters are found in the Toa Daeng peat swamp forests, and also from near the mouth of the Bang Nara River which is low lying and tidal. In Viet Nam, the species have been reported from low lying peat swamp forests dominated by Melaleuca cajuputi in lower Mekong. In Cambodia, the species mainly lives around the Tonle Sap Lake where the otters live mainly in the flooded forest and scrub surrounding the lake. Like many predators the Hairy-nosed Otter occurs in low density and the number and frequency of sightings are very few.In recent years, the tropical peat swamp forests are under severe threat due to the increasing frequency of fires and other anthropogenic activities such as clearing of forest to grow plantations of oil palm and food crops such as rice, corn and soya bean. Forest is also cleared for fish farming. In Viet Nam the entire Mekong Delta has been converted into rice fields reducing the habitat of otter and other wildlife species into a few pockets. In Malaysia (Sabah), fire reduced 70% of the Binsulok Forest Reserve and 10% of the Klias Forest Reserve. This has affected the surrounding environment and the biodiversity. In Indonesia over the last 20 years, the ecosystem has been reduced from almost 30 million hectares to only about 15 million hectares, and most of what remains has already been logged selectively. Such levels of habitat modification have profound effects on the native biodiversity.In its entire range the Hairy-nosed Otter is under increasing pressure due to intensive poaching (Yoxon and Yoxon 2007). In Cambodia, around the Tonle Sap Lake, poaching of otters and other wildlife is common practice. In Viet Nam otters are hunted for illegal wildlife trade, and also for meat and medical use.Populations in Viet Nam are known only from two small National Parks that are under intense pressure from the surrounding dense human population. Though there are other areas within the Mekong Delta that could contain other populations, with Mui Ca Mau the notable example, most are too small in size and suffering from similar problems to U Minh Ha and U Minh Thuong National Park.The illegal wildlife trade continues to grow and is the main factor behind this species decline. This trade shows no signs of abating and is likely to continue to push this species towards extinction. The natural low density of this species, its terrestrial ecology and its dependence on ecosystems that are often the first to be converted into agricultural land makes it extremely vulnerable to extinction.The principal threat to the fauna of Southeast Asian region is the burgeoning human population, and resultant biomass demand which puts pressure on natural resources. Unavailability of adequate prey species and suitable undisturbed habitat are putting additional pressure on all wildlife species including Hairy-nosed Otter.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

Habitat loss and conversion has led to a number of subpopulations becoming small and isolated (Bauer et al. 2008). Furthermore, trophy hunting has a net positive impact in a some areas, but may have at times contributed to population declines in Botswana, Namibia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe (Packer et al. 2009, 2011, 2013), Cameroon (Croes et al. 2011) and Zambia (Rosenblatt et al. 2014).ConflictThe economic impact of stock raiding can be significant: Patterson et al. (2004) estimated that each Lion costs ranchers in Kenya living alongside Tsavo East National Park US$290 per year in livestock losses. Likewise, annual losses of cattle to Lions in areas adjacent to Waza National Park in Cameroon comprised only about 3.1% of all livestock losses, but were estimated to represent more than 22% of financial losses amounting to about US$370 per owner (Bauer 2003). Consequently, Lions are persecuted intensely in livestock areas across Africa; their scavenging behaviour makes them particularly vulnerable to poisoned carcasses put out to eliminate predators. Little actual information exists on the number of Lions killed as problem animals by local people, even though this is considered the primary threat to their survival outside protected areas. Implementation of appropriate livestock management measures, coupled with problem animal control measures and mechanisms for compensating livestock losses, are some of the primary responses to resolving human-Lion conflict (Frank et al. 2006, Bauer et al. 2010, Hazzah et al. 2014).Prey depletionLion population density across the species’ range is known to track the biomass of principle Lion prey species; large wild herbivores (Van Orsdol et al. 1985, Hayward et al. 2007). The latter are increasingly under threat from an unsustainable and increasingly commercialized bushmeat trade, leading to collapses in prey populations across large parts of savanna Africa (Lindsey et al. 2013a). Regional Lion population trends reported in this assessment, are closely mirrored by time series data on main Lion prey species from 78 herbivore populations monitored between 1970 and 2005 in West, Eastern and Southern Africa; while herbivore population sizes increased by 24% in Southern Africa, they declined by 52% in Eastern Africa and by 85% in West Africa (Craigie et al. 2010).Use of Lion bones and body parts and derivatives for traditional medicineIllegal trade in Lion body parts for medicinal purposes is considered a threat to African Lion subpopulations (according to the regional Lion conservation strategies, which call on countries to prohibit [IUCN 2006a] and control [IUCN 2006b] trade in Lion bone and other parts and products) as well as to the small subpopulation in India's Gir Forest (M. Ventraman pers. comm. 2014). In West and Central Africa, Sogbohossou (2006) found many reported uses for Lion skins and bone in Benin (with fat and bones being most commonly utilized: N'Diaye 2014), and a survey carried out around Nigeria's Yankari National Park found more than 22 Lion parts considered to be of medicinal value, with most of the over 200 interviewees saying they had used Lion parts in the past, and half within the past three years (Born Free Foundation 2008). The widespread prevalence of fakes in the traditional medicinal market is indicative of a continued demand. While fakes may replace items in the market that otherwise would be illegally sourced from the wild, they could perpetuate demand and poaching when consumers aspire to the genuine wild item rather than making a conscious choice of an (often cheaper) alternative (Nowell 2014).There appears to be increasing interest in the use of African Lion bone in Asia. There is no history of Lion bone being used in traditional medicine there, but China has permitted the use of bones from captive Lions to make medicinal wines traditionally containing Tiger bone. South Africa has reported the export of large quantities of Lion bone sourced from captive animals to China, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Viet Nam. Legal international trade in bone reported as from captive-bred Lions could serve as a cover for illegally wild-sourced Lion (and other big cat) parts (Nowell and Pevushina 2014). There is also concern that wild Lion parts from eastern and Southern Africa could be drawn into the large illegal wildlife trade to Asia centred around elephant ivory.Trophy huntingTrophy hunting is carried out in a number of sub-Saharan African countries and is considered an important management tool for conserving wild land providing financial resource for Lion conservation for both governments and local communities. However, there is concern that management regimes have not always been sufficient to deter unsustainable offtakes (Packer et al. 2006). A sustainable offtake level of one male lion per 2,000 km² has been recommended (Packer et al. 2011), but offtake has been higher in many areas, which suggests that it is potentially a threat (Lindsey et al. 2013b). Trophy hunting can thus be a tool for conservation but also a threat, depending on how it is regulated and managed (Whitman et al. 2004, Loveridge et al. 2007, Packer et al. 2011). Hunter et al. (2013) cautioned that regulatory measures which reduce the profitability of Lion trophy hunting could have widespread negative impacts for wildlife-based land use, anti-poaching and tolerance of Lion outside protected areas.OtherDisease has also been a threat to Lion subpopulations (Munson et al. 2008, Trinkel et al. 2011). In parts of southeastern Tanzania there have been alarmingly high incidences of people killed by Lions, with up to 400 human Lion-related fatalities recorded from 1997-2007 (Ikanda and Packer 2007).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Industrial agriculture, along with subsistence agriculture, is the most significant driver of deforestation in tropical and subtropical countries, accounting for 80% of deforestation from 2000-2010. The current contribution of agriculture to deforestation varies by region, with industrial agriculture being responsible for 30% of deforestation in Africa and Asia, but close to 70% in Latin America. The most significant agricultural drivers of deforestation include soy, palm oil, and cattle ranching, all highly prevalent throughout Latin America (http://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/land-use/industrial-agriculture). The produce is mainly used for export as raw products for developing countries, not to feed local populations. Fragmentation and displacement frequently leads to lowering of densities of Jaguars and prey in leftover forest patches due to easier access and Jaguars feeding on the replaced livestock. Jaguar-livestock conflict is a serious threat to Jaguar survival and reported throughout their range (Hoogesteijn and Hoogesteijn 2011, Quigley et al. 2015, de la Torre et al. 2016).Latin America is characterized by relatively low population densities with high population growth (http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/). This means that the increased agricultural expansion will likely not be used to feed the expanding population of Latin America. Increased pressure on wildlife as a food source will increase. Even in low population countries like Belize, 75% of the yearly wildlife offtake can be attributed to humans, while Jaguars only account for 25% (Foster et al. 2016). Increases in human population within these thinly populated countries means, increased fragmentation for agriculture, industry and urbanization necessary for sustaining the increased number of people, making the wildlife easier accessible for hunting. The greater need for food and potential increase in wealth for a proportion of the population means increased commercialization and increased prizes for wildlife game species, which are all Jaguar prey species.Habitat loss is reducing and isolating Jaguar populations range wide (Medellín et al. 2002, Altrichter et al. 2006, Paviolo et al. 2008, Petracca et al. 2014, Medellín et al. 2016, de la Torre et al. 2017). Jaguars have lost about 49% of their historic geographic range (Medellín et al. 2002, Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010, Medellín et al. 2016; current assessment). The white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari) an important Jaguar prey (e.g. Foster et al. 2010b), has been extirpated from 21% of its historical range during the past century and changed from NT to VU under the latest IUCN assessment (Altrichter et al. 2012, Keuroghlian et al. 2013). Jaguars have become extinct in El Salvador, Uruguay, and the United States (where there are still periodic individuals present as presumed dispersers from Mexico) (TSJRT 2012, Campbell 2015). There are documented population declines and habitat loss for most of the range countries (Ceballos et al. 2011, Costa et al. 2005, Payán et al. 2013b, Wallace et al. 2013, Espinosa et al. 2016, García-Anleu et al. 2016, González-Maya et al. 2016, Hoogesteijn et al. 2016, Maffei et al. 2016, Mora et al. 2016, Moreno et al. 2016, Payán et al. 2016, Olsoy et al. 2016, Chávez et al. 2016, de Azevedo et al. 2016, Di Bitetti et al. 2016, Díaz-Santos et al. 2016). Connectivity among Jaguar populations is being lost at local and regional scales. For example, the connectivity of Jaguar habitat between Honduras and Guatemala is almost gone; similar losses have been documented across the Chaco, Iguazu and Atlantic Forest, and between Tamaulipas and Veracruz (Haag et al. 2010, Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010, Medellín et al. 2016, Ceballos et al. 2011, Chávez et al. 2016). Isolated populations have fewer individuals and are more prone to local extinctions (Ceballos et al. in press). Many Jaguar populations require connectivity between core sites to survive in the long term and these connectivity corridors are most of the time outside protected areas, and therefore vulnerable to human impacts (Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010, Bernal-Escobar et al. 2015). Even in nominally protected areas, Jaguars often suffer from human impacts such as illegal hunting (Quigley and Crawshaw Jr 1992, Medellín et al. 2002, Sollmann et al. 2008, Ceballos et al. 2011, Payán et al. 2013a, Petracca et al. 2014).The vulnerability of the Jaguar to persecution is demonstrated by its disappearance by the mid-1800 from Uruguay (Pereira-Garbero and Sappa 2016), El Salvador and by the mid-1900's from the south-western US (Johnson and Van Pelt 2016). Disappearance from these countries catches the current trends in a nutshell. These countries were the first areas to show rapid population increase with large scale land conversion. Retaliatory killing of the remaining exposed Jaguars led to their extinction. These processes are now taking place on a continental scale and therefore there are few areas within Jaguar range that can be considered safe. With limited technological expansion in the region, the main source of income will be industrial agriculture. With every (local) economic crisis, it means that the last Jaguar strongholds will be eroded further. Commercial hunting and trapping of Jaguars for their pelts has declined drastically since the mid-1970s, when anti-fur campaigns and CITES controls progressively shut down international markets (Nowell and Jackson 1996). However, there is still demand for Jaguar paws, teeth and other products, especially in local markets where canines are still considered interesting jewellery. On top of this, Jaguars are starting to be considered a replacement for tiger bone for traditional medicine purposes by the increasing Asian community in Latin America.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In KwaZulu-Natal alone, a recent survey of 92 people in rural settlements in the Wartburg, Estcourt and Creighton areas found that 82% of respondents hunt illegally (42% for meat and 46% hunted with dogs) on a regular basis, with 51% hunting every week (Grey-Ross et al. 2010). While Grey Rhebok was not explicitly mentioned as a target, we infer such hunting to affect this species. Protected areas close to urban areas exhibit increased predation by illegal sport hunting with packs of dogs and also feral dogs, such as in Bontebok National Park where recently eight Grey Rhebok were killed by dogs (C. Cowell unpubl. data). Similarly, the Cape Leopard Trust has raised serious concerns about the general decline of prey species and suspect that, due to the proximity of the Boland Mountains to the urban areas and expanding informal settlements, that the smaller antelope are targeted by snaring and hunted with dogs for bushmeat (C. Birss pers. comm. 2016). In Coleford Nature Reserve in the southern Drakensberg, where the Grey Rhebok subpopulation declined between 1986 and 2001, 79 dogs were removed from 1985–2002 and 96 snares were removed during 1990/91 alone (O’Connor and Krüger 2003). An initial subpopulation spike was coincident with the first removal of dogs from the reserve, which was probably symptomatic of escalated dog hunting in the adjacent properties and thus Grey Rhebok moving into Coleford Nature Reserve (O’Connor and Krüger 2003). In the Northern Cape, illegal hunting of Grey Rhebok by communal farmers is also a problem (C. Kraft pers. comm. 2016).Local declines are also suspected from increased densities of natural predators (Avenant 2013). Anecdotal reports from the Free State and Northern Cape suggest that an emerging threat is increased predation levels from higher abundances of mesopredators, especially Black-backed Jackal (Canis mesomelas) (Rowe-Rowe 1983b, C. Kraft and N. Avenant pers. obs. 2015), Caracals (Caracal caracal) (Palmer and Fairall 1988) and perhaps Leopard (Panthera pardus) in the arid areas (C. Kraft pers. comm. 2016). Poor carnivore management may be responsible for increased mesopredator abundance (Minnie et al. 2016).Habitat degradation may also play a role, such as climate-change or land-use induced bush encroachment (Hudak and Wessman 2001, Wigley et al. 2009) in areas such as the North West and Limpopo (Power 2014). There is no evidence for disease as a threat (Taylor et al. 2006), but Grey Rhebok may occasionally be affected by parasite infestation (Beukes 1988).It is likely that several threats synergise to cause subpopulation decline. For example, in Sterkfontein Dam Nature Reserve, Free State, the reasons behind declines are the observed increase in poaching (mainly hunting with dogs), increased predation rates due to the closure of the local vulture restaurant, and possibly habitat degradation related to increased frequency of fires (E. Schulze unpubl. data).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Although commercial trade is now much reduced (Yu 2010) this species continues to be hunted throughout most of its range for fur, for food and as pets. They are also widely viewed as poultry pests and killed in retribution. In villages around Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park on Sumatra, chicken depredation was frequently attributed to Leopard Cats, and commonly resulted in retribution killing of the species (McCarthy 2013). Island populations are small and seriously threatened in the Philippines and Japan. Leopard Cats can hybridize with domestic cats, as is shown by the popular domestic breed, the Bengal Cat although most of these exotic cats are now bred from Bengal Cat stock rather than wild crosses (TICA, The International Cat Association 2012). Hybridization in the wild has been reported, but is not considered a significant threat. Although this species is less dependent on forest cover than others, habitat loss and fragmentation is still a threat across most of its range (Nowell and Jackson 1996).",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

The loss of native forest, including important food trees for the species, to timber and conversion to plantations and cultivated land is a significant threat to the species in many parts of its range. Tropical storms and typhoons, including general increased hunting pressure following a storm, are considerable threats to many populations, most especially small remnant populations. Due to listing on Appendix I of CITES in 1989, there is little commercial hunting of P. tonganus in Polynesia and Micronesia (A. Brooke pers. comm.). However, in Vanuatu this species is sold in restaurants and one hotel advertises bat hunting on its web site (A. Brooke pers. comm.). On the island of Niue, nine months after Cyclone Heta struck in January of 2004, a decrease of 95% was found in relation to surveys conducted in 1998. A legal hunting season continued for the two to four month season following this cyclone, with ammunition being sold by the police department. Later a five year ban on hunting was enacted (Brooke 2004). On the island of Mangia, lack of habitat appears to be the biggest threat. Still, hunting is not restricted and  poses a threat on both Rarotonga or Mangia (Cousins and Compton 2005). Although bats are hunted for personal consumption in Fiji, the lack of development and firearms have protected P. tonganus from the wide-scale hunting of other islands (Palmeirim et al. 2005). In Tonga, after cyclone Waka hit the area in 2001, McConkey et al. (2004)  recorded a decline of more than 80% of bats they had recorded moving between 6 islands.

McCarthy and Mallon (2016) include several chapters exploring well-known and emerging threats including livestock depredation, prey declines, disease, illegal trade, climate change, and resource extraction. There is considerable variation in the type and extent of threat among countries, especially with respect to large countries such as China or Mongolia where suitable habitat is extensive and split across different administrative regions. The main ongoing threats fall into three broad areas: 1) competition with livestock, habitat degradation and declines in prey; 2) depredation by Snow Leopards on livestock and retaliatory killing; 3) illegal trade in furs, bones and other body parts. New threats have been identified since 2003, including climate change, mining, large scale infrastructure and barriers such as roads or fenced railway lines (Wingard et al. 2014, Zahler 2016); however, the potential impact of these emerging threats on Snow Leopards or their habitat is as yet difficult to quantify. A further set of threats regarded as less severe at the range-wide level, or at least more localized, include the lack of awareness among local people and policymakers, insufficient institutional capacity and law enforcement, and limited transboundary collaboration.Specific threats to particular populations are outlined below: Recently Nowell et al. (2016) found that over 90% of annual Snow Leopard poaching is estimated to occur in five range countries: China (103-236 animals poached per year), Mongolia (34-53), Pakistan (23-53), India (21-45) and Tajikistan (20-25). While the highest levels of poaching and illegal trade are in China, which has the largest share of Snow Leopard range, countries with smaller shares of global range were flagged for having disproportionately high levels of estimated poaching (Nepal and Pakistan) and illegal Snow Leopard trade (Afghanistan and Russia). Afghanistan, Bhutan and Kazakhstan had markedly low levels of seizures compared to observations of poaching and illegal trade, suggesting the need for strengthened law enforcement in these countries (Nowell et al. 2016).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

According to the Technical Meeting of the Vicuña Convention (2015) there has been, with the exception of Ecuador, an alarming increase in Vicuña poaching throughout its range, especially affecting isolated Chilean and relict populations whose marginal distribution increases their vulnerability. Among the factors that facilitate poaching of Vicuñas in the high Andes are (SACSG, 2014): 1) The wide geographic range of Vicuña populations and the extensive long frontier areas among the countries involved; 2) The geographic characteristics of the area, with low Vicuña population densities and a high degree of isolation; 3) Lack of human and technical resources devoted to protection of the species in the host countries; 4) High value of the fibre and Vicuña products in the international market; 5) Existence of a substantial market for illegal fibre and handcrafts at the local level; 6) Lack of effective punishment for illegal hunters; 7) Insufficient confiscation of illegal products; 8) Limited coordinated security forces within and between countries; 9) Limited benefits to local communities, and sometimes insufficient support and incentives to develop legal Vicuña use, resulting in greater benefits from illegal than from legal uses. Thus, it is considered of particular relevance that the following measures to be promoted:A) On cooperation among Andean countries:1. Intensification of inter-boundary cooperation among neighbouring countries, including security forces, for the control of international frontiers to optimize efforts to eliminate illegal traffic.2. Critical revision of the compliance with previous agreements and documents, developed during Technical Meetings of the Vicuña Convention on Vicuña poaching and trafficking.3. Standardized registry in the five countries of legally obtained fibre, its processing, imports and exports, in order to be able to monitor its commercialization.B) At the national level:1. Information dissemination regarding legal sanctions and the updating of national, regional, and local laws to make them more effective against poaching and illegal commercialization of Vicuña fibre and products.2. Facilitation and support of local Andean communities in the development of technical and organizational capacities to harvest fibre from their Vicuñas under strict animal welfare protocols and strengthening local community organizations.3. Governmental support to local Andean communities in the commercialization and value-added processes of legal fibre, simplifying the process and strengthening the stages of the legal chain of commercialization.4. Supply of sufficient legal fibre for local artisan use at subsidized prices, to minimize use of illegal fibre and increasing value added processes in the countries of origin.5. Reinforcing and implementation at the national level of schemes of supervision, legal oversight, and tracing origins of the fibre, from shearing to its conclusion on the supply chain (shearing, storage, transformation, commercialization, and export).6. Permanent training of police, judicial and customs authorities, with respect to legislation and other subjects related to production and movement of fibre, as well as identification of camelid fibres and their sub-products.7. The intensification of seizures of illegal clothing and the implementation of sanctions to those involved in purchasing or selling them.8. Implementation of informative and awareness campaigns, especially at touristic sites and airports, alerting tourists of the requirements to be met by legal Vicuña fibre products.C) On the cooperation between exporting and importing countries:1. Strengthening of local cooperation networks and swifter communication between CITES authorities and importing and exporting countries.2. Development and collaboration in the implementation of systems to trace the origin of Vicuña products and sub-products, to be implemented internationally.3. The strengthening of controls in the importing countries regarding the processing and marketing Vicuña products and sub-products.Despite the fact that participating countries are moving forward in the development of National Management and Conservation plans since the last Vicuña assessment (2008), as well as the provision of guidelines for sustainable management and animal welfare criteria, the lack of specific budgets or poor funding hinder achievement of conservation and management actions. Recent studies have shown that capture, handling, live-shearing and releasing wild Vicuñas under strict sustainable management and welfare protocols (although showing subtle and transitory behavioural and social structure changes after being released) does not compromise the conservation or maintenance of ecologically functional wild populations (Sahley et al. 2007, Arzamendia and Vilá 2012, Marcoppido et al. 2017). Among the two widely used methods for capturing Vicuñas, the traditional ‘Chaku’ (surround-capture by people on foot) results in less stress on animals than the use of motor vehicles to chase the animals (Sarno et al. 2009, Arzamendia et al. 2010). On the other hand, captive management has proven to have no contribution to Vicuña conservation (Lichtenstein 2006). Vicuñas, domestic camelids and introduced livestock have similar foraging preferences and share Andean habitats. As a result, local people perceive Vicuñas as a competitive species, and do not tolerate their presence (Lichtenstein and Renaudeau d'Arc 2004). This is especially worrisome around wetland (bofedales) habitats which are critical for Vicuñas (Koford 1957, Renaudeau d'Arc et al. 2000, Mosca Torres and Puig 2012, Mosca Torres et al. 2015) and locally shared with domestic animals (Borgnia et al. 2008, Wurstten et al. 2014, Arzamendia and Vilá 2015, McLaren et al. 2018). Vicuñas are frequently displaced by livestock, from the high-quality habitats to sub-optimal low-productivity habitats (Borgnia et al. 2008), where they still are able to persist. Further, the presence of herders with dogs represents an important stress factor for Vicuñas (Arzamendia and Vilá 2015). Habitat loss triggered by livestock over-grazing, and habitat fragmentation due to industrial and rural sprawl, and the development of large-scale mining projects may jeopardize the viability of Vicuña populations located beyond protected areas. Mining activities directly impact Vicuña populations by occupying preferred habitats and as a result of road kills due to high traffic levels, heavy machinery employed etc., and indirectly through the extraction and pollution of water resources (Mata et al. 2016).Climate change will probably have a detrimental impact in the fragile ecosystems where Vicuñas occur since they are at the limits of habitable environments. Therefore, the assessment of the potential effects of climate change on Vicuña’s habitats is a priority.Epidemiological studies on Vicuña wild populations in Bolivia, Perú and Argentina that share spatial and forage resources with domestic camelids and livestock do not show prevalence levels of endo- or ectoparasites that seem to be a problem for the viability of their populations (Chávez-Velásquez et al. 2005, Beltrán-Saavedra et al. 2011, Arzamendia et al. 2012, Marcoppido et al. 2016). However, a growing concern is emerging since some Vicuña populations throughout their distribution are suffering from mange caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. For example, two important protected areas for the species’ conservation are showing a high incidence of mange: San Guillermo National Park (San Juan, Argentina), created to preserve the two South American wild camelids in Argentina, and Pampa Galeras Bárbara D’Achille National Reserve (Ayachuco, Perú), the latter which symbolized the recovery of the species from the brick of extinction in the 60s of the past century. In San Guillermo the problem probably has to do with the introduction of domestic camelids without sanitary controls or quarantine, while in the case of other populations it is due to mismanagement practices related to the capture and shearing of animals, including incomplete preventive veterinary treatments, management without welfare, and overcrowding of animals creating stress. This situation also causes huge economic losses to the local communities because of the drop of Vicuña fibre price.  A potential threat both in the Andes and worldwide, is the breeding of paco-Vicuña (an alpaca/Vicuña hybrid) mainly promoted in developed countries out of the Vicuña distribution range for commercial purposes. The alpaca was domesticated from the Vicuña approximately 6-7,000 years ago (Wheeler 2012). During domestication and subsequent selective breeding, the genome was modified away from its Vicuña origin. Additional significant changes in the alpaca genome also occurred during the Spanish conquest when large numbers were slaughtered, and subsequent massive hybridization with llamas. DNA studies have shown that alpaca and llama pertain to different genera, Vicugna and Lama respectively, and at least 80% of alpacas in the Andes carry llama genes (Kadwell et al. 2001). Thus, hybridization between alpacas and Vicuñas represents a real threat because of the mixing of alpaca genes into the Vicuña genome, something that has not occurred in nature.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

However, despite knowing the relationship between landscape changes and predation, management is not yet effective, as declines of boreal Caribou have continued (COSEWIC 2014, Johnson et al. 2015). Landscape changes, especially transportation infrastructures, energy production plants and tourist resorts, often represent barriers for migrations, and are responsible for Reindeer population fragmentation in Norway (Panzacchi et al. 2013a,b; 2015). Some landscape changes, include mining about which concerns are locally strong, include dust and cumulative effects. Less is known about population versus individual responses to industrial development. An exception is the Central Arctic Herd in Alaska. The western part of the calving ground has been intensively developed as oilfields with networks of roads, pipelines and drill pads. Calf body mass and survival was affected by this development (Arthur and Del Vecchio 2009), but initially the herd increased partly as a result of a trade-off between development costs in better regulated hunting.Unregulated hunting and competition with domesticated Reindeer are documented threats for continental tundra Reindeer (Baskin 2005). However, mechanisms underlying widespread declines are incompletely understood, especially the role of predation, nutrition, disease and parasite interactions. Rangifer have been harvested for thousands of years and harvest is a part of the life and culture of northern aboriginal people. But, technology has changed hunting effort which is often uncoupled from Rangifer abundance leading to delays in detecting effects of unsustainable hunting. The conditions when, and if, harvesting becomes a threat are complex and although Rangifer is subject to management planning, the realities are that management responses are frequently hampered by mistrust of scientific data, disagreements about causes of declines, and time lags in institutional responses to implement management actions (Kolpaschikov et al. 2015). Climate change is rapid in the Arctic and its effects will be complex as relative and absolute forage availability changes, the timing of snow melt, ice freeze-up and break-up changes. A detrimental effect that can change the context of other threats is changes in the frequency of rain-on-snow or other icing events (Hansen et al. 2011, 2014) especially on the Arctic islands. Icing events can cause widespread changes in movements and deaths especially of calves and adult bulls. A warmer climate will have complex effects on parasites (Kutz et al. 2014) as some are adapted to a cool climate and their development may be reduced in warmer temperatures (Hoar et al. 2012). Warmer temperatures will change the distribution of intermediate hosts and vectors such as mosquitoes. In Finland, recent warmer summers increased mosquito activity leading to outbreaks of Setaria in Finnish Reindeer, causing many deaths (Laaksonen et al. 2010).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The habitat of A. h. hybridus is extremely fragmented, and there may be few populations of an adequate size to be viable in the mid- to long-term (Defler et al. 2003). Habitat alteration appears to be the most important threat to the Venezuelan population of A. h. hybridus. The lowland forest of the state of Zulia and the piedmond of the Perijá Mountains are heavily destroyed from expanding cattle-ranching activities (B. Urbani, unpubl.). Portillo and Velásquez (2006) undertook a gap analysis for this primate species within the Perijá Mountains and found that, while the total forest extent is still very large (813,257 ha), only 30% is relatively well preserved and protected. The rest remains affected by rapid human expansion and land clearance. Also in the Perijá Mountains, these monkeys seem to be favourite game animals (Lizarralde 2002). In central Venezuela, some areas that were reported with these monkeys (Cordero-Rodríguez and Biord 2001) were resurveyed by Duque (2007) without reports of any sightings; most of the area is already converted to secondary vegetation. Also in this region, B. Urbani (unpubl.) found that buffer areas around the protected areas—with confirmed populations of Ateles hybridus hybridus (P. N. Guatopo) and unconfirmed populations (M. N. Cueva Alfredo Jahn, P. N. Henry Pittier, P. N. San Esteban and P. N. El Ávila)—are transformed into cleared areas for slash-and-burn agriculture and human settlements as well as secondary forests.

Furthermore, damage to summer crops on Rhodes, attributable to fallow deer, has been recorded, and as there is no compensation system for damage caused by deer damages, persecution of animals could take place (D.

Reduction in primary forest has proceeded very fast throughout the lowland Sundaic region in the last 20 years, particularly at lower elevations (e.g. Holmes 2000, BirdLife International 2001, Jepson et al. 2001, McMorrow and Talip 2001, Lambert and Collar 2002, Kinnaird et al. 2003, Curran et al. 2004, Fuller 2004, Eames et al. 2005, Stibig et al. 2014). This will have caused population declines. Local occurrence of Banded Civet in Borneo is lower in logged areas than in unlogged areas (Brodie et al. 2014a,b). The Mentawai populations are impacted by economic development as human settlements expand into civet habitat, which also may result in conflicts since this species will prey on domestic livestock such as chickens (Schreiber et al. 1989). Hunting, often for trade, also threaten this species. Because Banded Civet spends a lot of time on the ground, it is exposed to snares and other traps. The species is hunted for food by some people in Sabah (Murphy 2007). Banded Civet has recently been recorded in the pet trade in Indonesia and is sometimes captured, possibly opportunistically, for display in zoos and wild animal collections (C.R.

E.J. Rode-Margono (pers. comm. 2014), D. Spaan and colleagues undertook 62 market surveys between February 2012 and July 2014, in 15 markets (13 in West Java including Jakarta, two in Bali); they recorded ferret badgers four times at Jatinegara (Jakarta): June 2012, four individuals; January 2014 one; May 2014, four individuals (immatures); June 2014, two dead individuals and one alive. In 2014 they also saw one infant in Garut (West Java). These numbers are very low compared with numbers of civets (Nijman et al. 2014). The species seems in 2014 to be consistently available in markets, whereas five years previously it was unusual to see in trade (C.R. Shephard pers. comm. 2014). The risk of trade rising is increased by the recent formation of 'civet-lovers' clubs (known locally as ‘cinta musang'), which also collect other small carnivores (E. Wilianto pers. comm. 2014). Availability of Javan Ferret Badger on on-line animal trading websites in Indonesia has also increased in recent years: this is likely to increase demand for the species because on-line sites reach a broader consumer audience and allow for ease of purchase (C.R. Shepherd pers. comm. 2015).Much of the forest habitat of Java has been converted to other uses, particularly agriculture, but this species does not depend upon extensive old-growth forest; it is unclear if it requires any sort of native forest. Domestic dogs are common on Java and represent a potential threat to Javan Ferret Badger, because a high proportion of its range is likely to be within a few kilometers of human settlement. Hunters' dogs are not rare in habitat such as that at Cipaganti (although stray dogs stay in the village); pig hunters go into the field almost every day, with dogs, they train their dogs by letting them hunt squirrels in bushy regrowth of fallows, and they leave dogs at little huts in the fields to chase away pigs by barking at night (E.J. Rode-Margono pers. comm. 2014). These might pose some threat but it is presumably not critical given that ferret badgers continue to use such areas. Hunting levels for small carnivores are much lower on Java than in northern South-east Asia (see Rode-Margono et al. 2014) and while some are doubtless killed (particularly given a recent rise in amateur leisure-seekers firing air-guns at anything they come across (E. Wilianto pers. comm. 2014), it seems unlikely that this would be sufficient to drive declines. Bird trapping is widespread and intensive on Java; trappers opportunistically take any small wildlife that they come across, for sale in the urban pet trade (C.R. Shepherd pers. comm. 2015); indeed the ground traps for birds widely used sometimes catch ferret badgers (E. Wilianto pers. comm. 2014).

Leopard Cats Prionailurus bengalensis in oil palm plantations die from haemorrhaging through eating rats poisoned by Warfarin and other anti-coagulant baits (Duckett 1976), and these would presumably affect other mammalian predators such as this civet, if it uses such plantations heavily. However, the limited survey in areas heavily used by people suggests it is rather well able to persist in landscapes retaining some patches of native forest, at general levels of threat. The species is occasionally hunted for food and treated as a pest because it is perceived as raiding poultry. In recent centuries and particularly recent decades, much of its range has been deforested. While the species is frequently recorded in edge and degraded areas, there is no indication that it can survive in non-wooded landscapes, or that oil palm plantations (which have replaced forest in much of its range) can support populations in the absence of forest. Forest conversion rates have considerably slowed in some of its range (e.g. Sabah, Malaysia) but remain high in some other parts (e.g. Sumatra); throughout, the highest losses tend to be in the level lowlands, which comprise part of the core habitat of this species.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

A recent analysis shows there are also synergistic effects of climate change and agricultural land use, indicating there may be a substantial increase of oil palm expansion into hill forests within the next few decades (Brodie 2016). The eminent threat of fragmentation hinders Bearded Pigs' ability to track seasonal resources across large areas. In Borneo, fragmentation prevents Bearded Pigs from exhibiting mass population eruptions and long-distance movements of the kind observed during the 1950s and 1980s, which haven't been observed since, even during successive masting events (Hancock et al. 2005). As Bearded Pig populations decline, hunting for meat, once sustainable in many areas, is probably now a serious threat in many places, as evidence by their extirpation from Lambir Hills National Park (Harrison 2011, Harrison et al. 2016).In Peninsular Malaysia, competition with Eurasian Wild Pigs (Sus scrofa) might also be a significant threat (Kawanishi et al. 2006). Habitat fragmentation favors the sedentary wild boar, and the available data indicate that wherever they are sympatric (not necessarily syntopic), the number of wild boar is greater than Bearded Pigs (Ickes 2001, Ickes and Thomas 2003, Maddox 2007, Luskin et al. 2014).In Sumatra, habitat loss and fragmentation have been the highest in the world over the last 20 years, putting S. b. oi at direct threat of extinction (Margono et al. 2011, Meitten 2012). The same situation probably applies to Bangka and the Riau Archipelago where the persistence of the species is unclear today.Repeated complaints about crop depredations by Muslim communities on the Sibutu and Tawitawi Islands in the southwestern Philippines have led to appeals to relevant authorities to try to eradicate these animals, and they may already be extinct there (Oliver 2001). Some earlier concerns that pose that fragmentation of Borneo's forests will allow the wholesale invasion of the island by S. scrofa (which are currently absent from the island) that could then displace S. b. barbatus (Kawanishi et al. 2008) seem to not have played out to date.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

However, few data to support this assessment have been traced, particularly because most key studies have not within the Sundaic region identified chevrotains to species. Thus, while clear that the genus remains widespread and common in the face of these threats, there seems to be little publicly available evidence that T. napu specifically does so, and reasonable evidence that it is not very adaptable to forest degradation (see Habitat and ecology). However, on the assumption that most chevrotains above 100 m asl on Borneo are this species rather than T. kanchil, Borneo at least retains large populations. Greater Oriental Chevrotain is extinct on Singapore (K. Lim pers. comm. 2008), although the relative contributions of hunting versus habitat perturbation are not known.Poaching pressure in Kerinci-Seblat National Park, Sumatra, among snared ungulates was greatest for muntjacs and lowest for chevrotains, as assessed by diameter of the cable (Linkie et al. 2003). Chevrotains were scarcer in areas of higher human use (and thus hunting) of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Sumatra (O'Brien et al. 2003; see Habitat and ecology). Bennett et al. (2000) profiled the effects of hunting in both Bornean states of Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah), each with eight study areas, upon chevrotains (not distinguished to species) through a lengthy hunting study in February 1993 to June 1995. They constituted 8–9% of animals killed. No direct or index measure of chevrotain densities was possible at these sites to determine what effects, if any, such heavy hunting was having on chevrotains. Chevrotains are among the most favoured wild meat by inhabitants of the Sarawak Planted Forests area, Bintulu, Sarawak, after Sambar Rusa unicolor and wild pigs Sus (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

There were substantial declines and local extinctions, driven by hunting for meat, extermination as an agricultural pest, and habitat conversion, particularly during British rule of India and adjacent countries, and immediately after independence (Raman 2013). Fewer than 20 years after independence, Schaller (1967) wrote that ""...the species has declined drastically throughout its range in India, and is now only locally abundant in some sanctuaries and forest tracts. The remaining populations are highly vulnerable to poaching, habitat destruction, and other forms of decimation"". The habitat loss of the past few centuries means that subpopulations are now rather fragmented. Now, in India, most subpopulations appear secure within the modern protected area network (Raman 2013), but those outside (now highly localised) are under rapid decline due to habitat conversion and extensive hunting (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). A relaxation of protection can lead to rapid decreases. For example, Chital used to be numerically the most abundant large herbivore in the Wilpattu National Park (Sri Lanka), but numbers declined significantly due to poaching which increased during management breakdown during the civil war, when its meat was even being sold next to the park. Poaching has also risen, for the same reason, in several other national parks in Sri Lanka (Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003). Where not prevented by effective conservation measures (active protection through patrolling and law enforcement, backed up by adequate awareness), people avidly hunt and poach Chital throughout their Indian range (Madhusudan and Karanth 2000, Madhusudan and Karanth 2002, Sankar and Acharya 2004, Bali et al. 2007) and there are occasional cases in even the best secured protected areas such as Corbett Tiger Reserve (Johnsingh et al. 2004). Many protected areas are well enough secured that the species has thrived well and, is now locally abundant (Sankar and Acharya 2004) and in such areas poaching of Chital is a more serious conservation problem for the large predators (every deer poached reduces predators’ food base; Karanth et al. 2004) than it is for Chital itself. In many other protected areas (especially those with a lower public profile) and for areas outside the conservation system, subpopulations are severely restrained by hunting. For example, densities in Bhadra Tiger Reserve are very low by comparison with what the habitat should support because of poaching with snares, dogs and shotguns, and also grazing competition with domestic stock (Jathanna et al. 2003), and the density was 87% lower in a heavily hunted area of Nagarahole National Park than in a well secured area (Madhusudan and Karanth 2000, 2002). Even though all hunting is illegal in this protected area, protection efficacy is uneven across the area. The Chital is one of the two most commonly hunted mammal species in the national park, partly because various facets of its behaviour and ecology such as herding behaviour and attachment to open habitat allow its ready detection and killing, and quick entry and exit by poachers. It is therefore exposed to far higher hunting pressure than are the ungulates which are solitary and spend much time in dense cover (Madhusudan and Karanth 2002). Poaching is probably operative to a greater or lesser extent in most subpopulations, but at low enough levels that recent decades have not seen, with Chital, the frequent local extirpations from areas of prime habitat of earlier decades.The most serious threat, in areas where poaching and habitat conversion are well controlled, is the reduction in carrying capacity through competition with livestock, especially during the pinch season as observed in Sariska (Sankar 1994); Chital and livestock are known to have dietary overlap (Raman 2013). The problem has been documented almost throughout Chital’s range but awareness that it is a problem at all remains so low that it is not even recognised as a key conservation issue in many protected areas (e.g. Mathai 1999). In Gir Lion Sanctuary and National Park, Chital population density increased 14-fold from 3.57 animals per km2 in 1970–1971 (Berwick 1974) to 50.8 animals per km2 in 1989 (Khan 1996, Khan et al. 1996). This was attributed to the rapid and complete removal of pastoral settlements, their livestock, and a total ban on several thousand migratory livestock. Dung densities of Chital and livestock were also negatively correlated in Gir, indicating avoidance and possible competitive interaction between the species. With removal of human impact and increase in forage availability, Chital subpopulations increased, as testified by higher Chital densities in the vicinity of abandoned settlements (nesses; Sharma and Johnsingh 1995). Similarly, in Bardia National Park (Nepal), protection from livestock grazing (and logging) in 1975 increased measured Chital subpopulations from 30–34 per km2 in 1977 (Dinerstein 1980) to over 200 per km2 in the early 1990s (Naess and Andersen 1993, Moe and Wegge 1994). In Bandipur Tiger Reserve, mean densities of Chital were 11 times higher in livestock-free areas than in adjacent livestock-grazed areas. In shared grazing areas, these Chital densities declined sharply with increasing livestock densities. In the studied grazed area, halving the livestock density allowed an increase in Chital density by a factor of five (Madhusudan 2004). Threats to southern India’s forest ungulates by competition with domestic stock grazing within protected areas are exacerbated where dung is collected for export to adjacent coffee areas. Fuel wood removal may also be at levels sufficient to disrupt nutrient cycles of the habitat (Madhusudan 2005). All these pressures interact to have, overall, a major depression of Chital densities. In Bhadra, following the departure from the park of human settlements and consequent removal of anthropogenic pressures on Chital and habitats, Chital subpopulations bounced back by nearly seven times in fewer than four years (Karanth and Kumar unpublished data). Karanth et al. (1999) earlier documented their empirical observations of the recovery of Chital subpopulations in Nagarahole.Chital are susceptible to livestock-borne diseases such as rinderpest (Schaller 1967) and foot-and-mouth disease (Sankar 1994) but the current population is too widespread for these to rank as potential global-level threats. Accidents, especially from speeding vehicles, are a cause of Chital mortality but occur rarely within protected areas and cannot be significant at the global level. Many Indian forest areas are severely encroached by exotics such as Lantana camara, Parthenium spp. and Chromolaena odorata (= Eupatorium odoratum), and these are suspected to effect major changes to forest structure (Hiremath and Sundaram 2005): but their effects on Chital warrants further study. Wild-ranging domestic dogs are also likely to be a problem (Raman 2013), but no study quantifying their effects has been traced. There are no predictable threats to the Sundarbans subpopulation of Bangladesh, but as a low-lying area extreme weather events might cause episodic major population removal, as happened with hurricane Sidr in November 2007 (Md Anwarul Islam in litt. 2008).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

White-lipped Peccaries form large herds and consequently require extensive and contiguous areas of habitat to obtain sufficient resources throughout the year. Hunting pressure by landless squatters and poachers has also contributed to local extinctions of the conspicuous White-lipped Peccary herds in many Neotropical forest fragments (Cullen, Bodmer and Valladares-Padua 2001). The loss and fragmentation of their habitat also exposes them to increased hunting pressure by providing more access to human hunters. Hunting may have a devastating impact on a herd of white-lipped peccaries, because large numbers are killed at one time. Peres (1996) documented local extinctions at all of his Amazonian sites which had heavy to moderate hunting pressure. Even light hunting may be a problem in certain regions of terra-firme forest, where resources are limited and peccary population densities are naturally low (Peres 1996). In most of its biogeograhical range, the progressive destruction of habitat for agriculture and cattle ranching, as well as timber extraction, has already accounted for much of the species' habitat loss (Altrichter and Boaglio 2004, Altrichter et al. 2012). As of 2005, large populations of White-lipped Peccaries persisted only in 21% of its historic range (Altrichter et al. 2012). The species exposure to over hunting and local extinctions of apparently healthy populations in large conservation units is now well documented in several areas of Brazil (e.g. Roraima, Fragoso 2004; Iguaçu National Park, Azevedo and Conforti, 2008; Plateau region of the Mata Atlantica, Morro do Diabo, Mangini pers. comm.; and the Mata Atlantica of Bahia, Flesher, pers. comm. Whether this is due to epidemics, over hunting or other factors is still unclear (Keuroghlian et al. 2012). In the Atlantic forest there are very few populations within suitable habitat large enough to be exempt from extinction in the region (Jorge et al. in prep.). Researchers working in the fragmented Atlantic forest biome had evidence of sharp, sometimes unexplained, population declines (Keuroghlian et al. 2012). Southeastern Brazil is densely populated, and native habitats have been extensively fragmented. In most cases with a similar scenario, recolonization of small, isolated fragments would be impossible without human intervention, because source populations are not available in the vicinity to replace populations that become locally extinct (Keuroghlian 2003).Similarly, Fragoso's (2004) documented a concern for the species in Roraima due to strong evidence of periodic and sometimes permanent White-lipped Peccary population crashes which seem density-dependent and are most likely due to epizootic events. Reported diseases has been documented in free ranging White-lipped Peccary populations (Karesh et al. 1998, Herrera et al. 2008, Freitas et al . 2010). This is a particular cause of concern due to the increasingly fragmented distribution of White-lipped Peccary populations. One risk is that isolated populations that crash may have difficulties recovering since they are cut off from dispersal of potential source population areas.In November 2010, the IUCN and the Instituto Chico Mendes (ICMBio), the Federal Institute for Biodiversity Conservation, and official assessor of species red listing for the Brazilian Ministry of Environment, signed an agreement to build the Brazilian Red List of Threatened Species. The White-lipped Peccary (which was not included in the previous official Brazilian list of threatened fauna - MMA, 2003), was then classified as Vulnerable in Brazil (A2abcde+A3abcde). In the endangered Cerrado biome, it was classified as Endangered, and the only ungulate that received a Critically Endangered classification for the Atlantic forest Biome (Keuroghlian et al. 2012). This change of status is due to the intensification of threats and most importantly, to the increase of knowledge about the species. According to the workshop participants in Brazil, a population decline of at least 30% in the last 18 years (three generations) is suspected, and an equal population decline is projected for the next 18 years.Another important result from this regional assessment in Brazil was learning that local extinctions of White-lipped Peccary in pristine areas not only occurred in Brazil, but also in other areas. For example, in French Guiana, Richard-Hansen, Khazraie, Surugue, and Grenand (in prep.) show data that clearly supports the evidence of a population crash during the last 4 years. In Bolivia, White-lipped Peccaries have become locally extinct in areas surrounding a Tsimane village in the Estación Biológica Beni (Roldan and Simonetti 2001). In Ecuador, according to the published Red List (Tirira 2011), White-lipped Peccaries are considered Endangered in the Amazon, and Critically Endangered in the Pacific Coast. In the Ecuadorian Amazon, White-lipped Peccaries have been already extirpated from large areas along the lower slopes of the Andes, and are rapidly disappearing from all parts of their geographic range due to overhunting (and perhaps disease). In the Coast, where large-scale deforestation occurred during the past century, G. Zapata-Ríos (pers.comm.) documented only a few small populations remaining in Cotacachi Cayapas Ecological Reserve and its buffer zone area. Recently, in December 2010, Mexico's National Secretary of Environment also classified the species as endangered (R. Reyna-Hurtado pers. comm.). In the Chaco of Paraguay, the alarming rates of deforestation and continued hunting are a cause for alarm, and although no formal survey has taken place recently, the number of herds as well as the number of individuals in a herd is notably declining (J. Campos pers. comm.).Both the Collared Peccary (Pecari tajacu) and White-lipped Peccary are important resources for subsistence hunters in the Peruvian Amazon, as elsewhere in the Amazon basin (Bodmer et al. 2004a). Bodmer (1995), Peres (1996), and Redford and Robinson (1987) showed that peccaries were a preferred game of native and non-native people in the Amazonian region. In Peru, subsistence hunting of peccaries is permitted and is legally defined as the use of peccary meat for household consumption or the sale of peccary meat in settlements of fewer than 3,000 inhabitants. Rural inhabitants hunt peccaries mainly for their meat, which has an economic value of approximately $23 for a Collared Peccary and $30 for a White-lipped Peccary either for subsistence food or sale (Bodmer et al. 2004b). Peccary pelts are sold as a by-product and have an economic value to hunters of approximately $5 for a Collared Peccary pelt and $3 for a White-lipped Peccary pelt (Bodmer and Pezo 2001, Fang 2003). The only country with CITES permit to export white-lipped peccary pelts for the hide trade is Peru where from 1997 to 2008 a quota of between 35,500 and 44,300 skins and leather products has been granted annually (CITES Database 2008, www.cites.org). The pelts are tanned in Peru and sold to the European leather industry for the manufacture of high quality shoes and gloves, with the latter retailing for as much as $200 a pair. However, this activity should be careful controlled because of potential risks to White-lipped Peccary given that population monitoring methods are problematic. Also, since some pelts are rejected because of scars, parasite marks (e.g., bot flies), or bullet holes, this raises the question as to how many individuals are killed in total to obtain pelts that meet the required quality standards for international trading? Other South American countries such as Argentina and Bolivia, are exploring plans for the international commercialization of peccary pelts under CITES. Detailed surveys of the subsistence and commercial use of this species on national scales have not been undertaken in other South American range countries except Argentina (Altrichter 2005).At the southern and northern extremes of this species' distribution its status is of particular concern. In the Argentine Chaco, Altrichter (2005) found that hunting of White-lipped Peccary was not sustainable because density of this species was three times lower in areas closer to villages than in protected areas, hunters did not discriminate between age and sex, and more than 40% of the population's production was being harvested. Population size was estimated to be at 60% of the carrying capacity (Altrichter 2005). Threats to the species in Mesoamerica (Tropical Mexico and Central America) include hunting and habitat reduction as well as un-managed legal sport hunting in a couple of Mexican States (Campeche and Quintana Roo, Reyna-Hurtado 2009a). Overall in Mesoamerica this species' situation is alarming due to rapid population decline over the last 20 years. In Mexico this species has been extirpated from Veracruz, Tabasco, Yucatan and survive only in a few populations on the largest reserves and a few large communal forests where the species is under strong hunting pressure (Reyna-Hurtado and Tanner 2007). A similar pattern has occurred for almost all the Central America countries where the species is now confined to the few large tropical forest reserves (Altrichter et al. 2012).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Indeed, these two threats are often associated and all Borneo’s ungulates suffer from the increased hunting that often accompanies logging (Bennett and Dahaban 1995, Bennett and Gumal 2001), such that hunting to local extinction is the chief detrimental effect of logging on ungulates in Sarawak (Bennett and Gumal 2001). This conclusion probably is applicable across the range of Sambar, within which it is heavily hunted (e.g. Duckworth et al. 1999, Walston 2001, Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002, Linkie et al. 2003, Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003, Tilson et al. 2004, Rao et al. 2005, Steinmetz et al. 2008, Saw Htun pers. comm. 2008). It is among the most sought-after wild meats in Indonesia (Semiadi 2005), Sarawak (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008), and Viet Nam (B. Long pers. comm. 2008), and during 1988–1993 it was a common and preferred food in rural Lao PDR (Duckworth et al. 1999, Table 1), and is probably near the top of chosen wild meats throughout most of its range (GMA Indonesia workshop); however, it is less favoured in Taiwan compared with Formosan Serow Capricornis crispus and Reeves’s Muntjac Muntiacus reevesi (Chang Shih-Wei pers. comm. 2008). However, it is now so rare in Nam Ha National Protected Area, Lao PDR, that a more recent hunting study found it to be eaten only rarely (Johnson et al. 2003). In Viet Nam, muntjac meat is now often served in wildlife restaurants as Sambar, because real Sambar meat is now so difficult to procure (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). These declines in consumption are probably representative of all Lao PDR and Viet Nam, and of increasing proportions of the rest its range, reflecting population losses (see Population).There are major, ongoing, declines in at least Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Nepal, and probably Sri Lanka and Indonesia (see Populations) which can plausibly only be driven by hunting, because suitable habitat for Sambar is abundant in these countries but is almost or actually bereft of the species. Even in India, poaching has seriously depleted the abundance of large mammals in most areas; even in high-profile areas such a Corbett Tiger Reserve and Rajaji National Park there are still some instances of poaching (Johnsingh et al. 2004). An intensive study of hunting on mammals in two Hmong villages of northern Thailand classified quarry species into tiers representing the sequence of loss through overhunting; Sambar fell in the second tier (aside, e.g., big cats Panthera) in the extinction sequence (Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002). This study found that Sambar persisted anomalously long in one place under an “exceptional village wildlife hunting regulation promulgated by the village headman until 1994”, but was generally extinct in the landscape. A study at Nagarahole National Park compared an area which was only moderately hunted with a heavily hunted site, but found no significant difference in Sambar densities between the two areas (Madhusudan and Karanth 2002). This was speculated to reflect the greater difficulty of hunting Sambar (highly dispersed and usually in rather thick vegetation), despite it being a prized species, than, particularly, Chital Axis axis, a herding species often out in the open, and the benefit to poachers of getting in, making a kill, and getting back out again as fast as possible to reduce detection chances; therefore, this pattern seems to have arisen through hunter choice. In the context of Indochina, even the heavily-hunted site would, however, rank as lightly hunted (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008, based on visit and discussion). For these two reasons, their finding, of an apparent high resilience of Sambar to hunting, is not applicable to the rest of the species' range (particularly outside well-secured protected areas). However, somewhat reflecting this, Sambar’s status in non-Sundaic South-east Asia (still widespread but in ongoing steep decline) relative to other large deer ecologically more similar to Chital (herding; often outside dense forest), Eld’s Deer Rucervus eldii and Hog Deer Axis porcinus (extinct across most of their former range through former steep declines) does indeed suggest a broad applicability of a conclusion that Sambar is somewhat less rapidly reduced by hunting than are other sympatric deer, excepting muntjacs Munitacus spp.Deer are hunted in India using snares, dogs, and guns (Jathanna et al. 2003; Kumara and Singh 2004) and these methods are general across their range. Some hunting is for village consumption of meat, but most (at least in South-east Asia) is probably sold commercially, to the affluent urban classes (e.g. Duckworth et al. 1999, Walston 2001, Kumara and Singh 2004), and to itinerant labourers, such as logging crews in at least Sarawak (Bennett and Gunal 2001) and gold-diggers and rattan-cutters in Myanmar (in Myanmar (A. Lynam pers. comm. 2014 based on observations in 2002, J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). Such commercially-driven hunting causes major declines (e.g. Steinmetz et al. 2008) because the market is limitless. Adult males suffer additionally because antlers are widely displayed as trophies and are used in traditional medicine (e.g. Martin 1992, Baird 1995). At least in Lao PDR, their market value means that, compared with muntjacs, a high proportion is sent to towns and traded internationally, and many are sold openly in tourist centres such as Louangphabang (Duckworth et al. 1999). In Taiwan, in the past live males were sought for farming velvet; this was far more valuable than the meat. Presently, velvet can be bought legally and cheaply from farms and hunting for velvet is now insignificant, as is, here, hunting for internal organs (Chang Shih-Wei pers. comm. 2008). Hunting pressures and patterns vary across Sambar’s range: three areas (Indochina; Malaysian Borneo; Taiwan) are profiled below, and all are very different not just from each other, but from southern and central India, where (excepting Taiwan) the species has by far the healthiest conservation status. But even across India, hunting for Sambar meat is almost ubiquitous, even occurring within well-secured protected areas, and to greater extents in other protected areas and outside the protected area system (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008).Viet Nam, Lao PDR and to a lesser extent Cambodia and northern Thailand are apparently the areas of Sambar’s range where generalised mammal hunting is heaviest. Sambar is hunted within a thriving hunting and wildlife trading culture in this area and in adjacent countries such as China and Thailand, involving many land vertebrate species, along with other forest products such as orchids and Aquilaria resin (e.g. Compton and Le Hai Quang 1998, Compton et al. 1999, Noreen and Claridge 2001, Smith and Xie Yan in press). Such hunting reaches all areas, although in large rugged mountain forest blocks trade-driven hunting of species valued only for their meat (rather than high-value, low-weight, generally medicinal products that can be carried out efficiently from even the remotest areas) is still limited by economics of accessibility. However, the ability of these areas to protect Sambar at the regional scale is questionable, because no areas of rugged evergreen forest are known with high Sambar densities: such habitat is rather marginal. The regional wild meat trade has little likelihood of abating as long as there are any of the most resilient species (pigs, muntjacs, and civets) to be hunted. The human population of Viet Nam is more than 84 million, that of China more than 1,000 million. Together, they comprise an enormous market for wildlife products. For example, tens of millions of wild turtles are imported, legally and illegally, into China annually (van Dijk et al. 2000 and papers therein). There has been no comparable study of ungulate trade levels. Within the Northern and Central Annamites, every square kilometre of Viet Namese forest and of Lao forest that is within 5 km of the Viet Namese border probably has snares capable of capturing Sambar set in it every year (Timmins et al. 2007; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Intensity in some areas probably reaches many thousands of snare-nights per km2 per year (Timmins et al. 2007). Snaring is less intensive in Lao PDR at least away from the Vietnamese border, but is increasing dramatically (Timmins and Robichaud 2005; W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2007; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, 2014). Hunting intensity has in recent decades been generally lower in southern Viet Nam than in Lao PDR and northern Viet Nam, leaving many wildlife populations less depleted (e.g. Le Xuan Canh et al. 1997, Timmins and Duckworth 2000, Polet and Ling 2004 ), but the general increase in regional hunting intensity and economic wealth indicate that hunting intensity in this region must also be increasing, as suggested by a recent survey of forest in Dak Nong Province which detected Sambar only once and found many indications of extremely high hunting pressure (Timmins in press). Rapid economic development and expanding wealth, particularly Southeast Asia and China, are increasing the demand for wildlife meat and ‘medicines’ (e.g. TRAFFIC et al. 2008). Timmins et al. (2007) highlighted a common misconception, especially in documentation of development projects in the region, that poverty is a principal cause of biodiversity loss: as they pointed out for Saola Pseudoryx nghetinhensis, the main driver of threats to wild ungulates in Indochina, at least for the mid-term, is not rural poverty but increasing urban wealth in Indochina and China. In Viet Nam “the free market economy has resulted in feverish periods of trade in wild species nationwide, with negative impacts on biodiversity” (Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2004). In Cambodia, the same factor has fostered a thriving bushmeat market and hunting of species for international wildlife trade (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins 2006, Maxwell et al. 2007), and the intensity of hunting there for some species (Sambar included) is likely to exceed even that in Viet Nam. This reflects the logistical ease of hunting and trading with few controls and the relative abundance of high-value quarry species (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). There is a rapid, ongoing, expansion of wealthy social strata in Lao PDR, Cambodia, and Viet Nam, directly accelerated by illegal trade in timber, wild meat, and other forest resources, and by the economics of large infrastructure projects (e.g. Nan Theun 2 hydro-electric power project), creating a significantly greater in-country demand for luxury meats such as venison (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2007). Markets along major roads such as route 13 through Lao PDR (e.g. at Ban Namthon) have expanded, not contracted, in the last 15 years (up to 2008) and have a huge (albeit unquantified) turnover of wild meat; at this specific market, multiple stalls are selling dried deer meat daily. The effects of hunting in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Thailand have been exacerbated during the last two decades by habitat loss and various socio-economic factors, of which the most biologically significant are discussed in the Red List account for Large-antlered Muntjac M. vuquangensis (Timmins et al. 2008). The most significant constraint to Indochina’s Sambar populations is the long-term uncertainty of success in protected areas, even in those currently effective in conservation management. Even the most successful protected areas face an uncertain future with the possibility of degazettement of conservation status of parts of them, the lack of, or possible future loss of, adequate external funding necessary to maintain high standards of management, the lack of, or possible future loss of, political support necessary to uphold high protection standards and the uncertainties of maintaining a motivated and well-trained staff.On Borneo, Sambar is also widely and heavily hunted, largely for meat consumed in-country (Bennett et al. 2000, Mohd Azlan J. pers. comm. 2008, Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008, G.M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008, A.C. Sebastian pers. comm. 2008, Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008). Traditionally, hunters used traps, dogs and spears, and blowpipes. Hunters in remote parts of the interior still use these methods, but most animals now die by gunfire. Sarawak held 60,000 legally registered shotguns while Sabah held almost 13,000 in the mid 1990s (Bennett et al. 2000). Methods used in Indonesia include guns and spotlights along logging roads, snaring, and dogs (G.M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008, S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). Snaring is still very heavy outside well-secured areas, but shotguns remain the even bigger problem (Bennett et al. 2000, Mohd Azlan J. pers. comm. 2008, A.C. Sebastian pers. comm. 2008, Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008). Over most of (at least) Malaysian Borneo, “in general, everyone will hunt and eat anything” (Bennett et al. 2000). Much hunting is for the market rather than local use, so there is a limitless demand. Bennett et al. (2000) and Bennett and Gumal (2001) profiled the hunting of ungulates in Sarawak in the mid 1990s thus: Sambar (along with Bearded Hog Sus barbatus and muntjacs Muntiacus) is heavily shot for wild meat trade across Sarawak, and these ungulates are the species most sought by the restaurants; Sambar in particular is an important source of meat for logging company employees in Sarawak. Wild meat is widely sold in towns, villages, restaurants and logging camps throughout Sarawak; 250 sales outlets were estimated across the state in 1996, with an annual trade worth 3.75 million USD. Along the Rejang river alone, in the mid 1980s, 1,500 Sambars were sold per year (Caldecott 1988). The market for meat is great and probably expanding. Bennett et al. (2000) considered the effects of this onslaught upon Sambar through a lengthy hunting study in February 1993 to June 1995, in both Bornean states of Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah), each with eight study areas. Sambar constituted only 6.7% of animals killed in Sabah, but 35% by weight of wild meat; negligible numbers were taken in Sarawak, reflecting the major declines that had already reduced the species to rarity. Index counts of signs show an inverse relationship between sign index and hunting pressure so strong that the latter over-rode the effects of habitat variables in determining their densities. Hunting was so ubiquitous, even in protected areas, that in the two states, only one site (part of Danum Valley, Sabah) could be found as a control, where there was primary forest but negligible hunting levels. They concluded that “the only single factor offering any effective protection for [quarry species of] wildlife is difficulty of access”; whether animals are protected or non-protected species, inside or outside protected areas, had no significant restraint on hunting levels. There were, then, no official controls on commercial hunting of non-protected species. The Master Plan for Wildlife in Sarawak (Wildlife Conservation Society and Sarawak Forest Department 1996) introduced a strict ban on all wildlife trade, shotgun ownership and cartridge sales in the late 1990s (Bennett and Gumal 2001). Substantial numbers of Sambars are, nevertheless, still killed in the state, as they are elsewhere in Borneo. Although locally selective logging has probably benefited Sambar populations in some areas by creating more favourable habitats (e.g. Brodie in press b, c), and potentially increasing carrying capacity, the indirect effects of logging undoubtedly greately outweighs any potential benefit (Bennett and Gumal 2001). Moreover, in the interim since the Master Plan, much forest has been completely lost and Sambar populations in the smaller and more isolated areas that remain must now be even more vulnerable to local extinctions. For most Sambar populations inaccessibility is still essentially the only real protection for the species, and there are few inaccessible areas left (J. Brodie in litt 2014).  In a study area of almost half a million hectares in Sarawak Sambar detection probability declined by almost 40% between 2008-2014 (B. Giman pers. comm. 2014). This apparent decline coincided in part with harvesting of Acacia mangium although as of 2014 harvesting activity had only affected a few plantation compartments. The decline was also attributed to uncontrolled illegal hunting; prior to harvesting few people were involved in plantation activity, but for the period 2012-2014 many workers were brought in, and this resulted in many people hunting on a nightly basis. Additionally the harvesting activity destroyed an important mineral lick (B. Giman pers. comm. 2014).Taiwan contrasts with the rest of Sambar range in that hunting has been so successfully reduced that populations are now increasing in large parts of the island. It was formerly a big problem, for venison and, for medicinal purposes, velvet and penis. The reduction during and since the 1990s reflects five factors. Hunting of Sambar was banned in 1989 through the Wildlife Conservation Act. Velvet prices fell steeply during 1985–1990 with deer TB in 1985, reducing returns from poaching absolutely an effect exacerbated by rapid economic development in 1980s leading to higher daily wages. Former logging road systems are deteriorating within protected areas, making removal of deer meat less attractive. The general awareness of ecological conservation has much enhanced. And eco-tourism through community forestry plans has given alternative employment to former hunters (all information: Lin, C.-Y. and Lee, L.-L. pers. comm. 2008).  Other sympatric ungulates are hunted broadly as avidly as Sambar, but there is suggestive evidence from two areas of Thailand (Kuiburi National Park and a 20 km² sector of Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary) that when Sambar densities are very much reduced, recovery may be more difficult than with Gaur Bos gaurus and muntjacs. In both these areas the institution of effective protection fuelled a rise in sign density, and presumably animal populations, for Gaur and muntjacs, but not for Sambar (Steinmetz et al. 2007, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). A similar scenario may be ongoing in eastern Cambodia, where Sambar numbers are extremely low (Nuttall et al. 2014; O’Kelly et al. 2012; Gray et al. 2013, 2011), presumably because of targeted hunting; yet despite the instigation of protection measures which up to at least 2008 appeared to have moderated hunting pressure there has been no visible sign of recovery (Nuttall et al. 2014). But currently significant levels of hunting still exist and have probably been increasing recently, due both to changes in the dynamics of poaching and to some extent protected area management (Nuttall et al. 2014, S. Brook pers. comm. 2014, T. Gray pers. comm. 2014, T. Lynam pers. comm. 2014), and perhaps this could be a significant factor in recovery (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).  If these finding are widely applicable the implications for Sambar populations in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, northern Thailand, Peninsula Malaysia, Sarawak and other areas where populations are mostly down to scattered tiny numbers, may be profound. Over many centuries, the loss of wilderness to human settlement, cultivation and industry has resulted in massive loss of potential Sambar range, particularly in the densely-settled countries of India, China, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Throughout the range of Sambar, natural and semi-natural habitats (forest, shrubland and grassland) continue to be converted to anthropogenic habitats, degraded (e.g. stands are being changed in character through logging) and fragmented (broken into smaller blocks). The relative proportions of these activities vary across the range as does the percentage of former forest land so affected. The role of these habitat changes as a direct stimulant of the major declines in progress is unclear. Sambar is highly tolerant of forest degradation: indeed, much higher numbers are found in encroached stands than in pristine closed-canopy forests, if hunting is under control (Rijksen 1978; Heydon 1994; Stuebing 1995; Davies et al. 2001, Brodie et al. in press b, c). Degradation per se is unlikely to be a significant threat. Many Indian forest areas are severely encroached by exotics such as Lantana camara, Parthenium spp. and Chromolaena odorata, and these are suspected to effect major changes to forest structure (Hiremath and Sundaram 2005): but their effects on Sambar populations warrant further study. There is no evidence that Sambar can survive complete conversion of landscapes to non-forest uses such as rice paddies, and its ability to use tree plantations in the absence of natural forest is unclear. Probably, like most deer, provided strips of semi-natural vegetation survive (e.g. along streams and on steep slopes) are present, it can use them to some degree. In most of its range (parts of India excepted) it is unlikely that habitat extent is the determining factor of current Sambar numbers, because large tracts of apparently suitable habitat now support no or only tiny numbers of Sambar. By far the most serious effect of current habitat trends is that fragmentation opens up wilderness areas to people, making it easier to hunt throughout them and cheaper to remove bulk wildlife products such as Sambar meat. In both Malaysian Borneo and Lao PDR the ‘natural protection’ afforded to an area through difficulty of access has been considered to be the chief factor allowing populations of large, hunted, mammals to survive (Timmins and Duckworth 1999, Bennett et al. 2000), and this is probably widely true for Sambar outside India, Nepal and the few other areas where active protective measures are effective. Although Sambar has a wide tolerance of habitat types, numerous observations and studies have indicated that highest densities and presumably habitat preferences of the species correlate with factors such as relatively gentle terrain, river plains, stream and other wetland vicinities, habitat ecotones, and secondary formations originating from closed canopy forests (Simcharoen et al. 2014; Lynam et al. 2012, Brodie et al. in press b, c), all factors which correlate positively with ongoing anthropogenic pressures and thus suggest that optimal habitats (and thus potentially a significant proportion of the global Sambar population) are correlated in one way or another with high threat levels for the species.  In sum, the proximate cause of the major ongoing Sambar declines in most of its range is hunting, for which habitat conversion and fragmentation exacerbate the effects; and these processes are resulting in an ever-smaller maximum possible population, were the hunting issues to be successfully addressed.  Threats other than hunting and, locally, habitat loss, seem to be insignificant at the species level. Hybridization with Javan Rusa Rusa timorensis has been documented (Van Mourik and Schurig 1985), and is apparently a localized threat, where the latter has been introduced into Sambar range, in Pewajam District, East Kalimantan (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2006) and potentially more widely (Corlett 2010). Hybridization has also been suspected in Sumatra, with the introduced Chital Axis axis (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2006). However, Sambar and Chital co-occur extensively in India without hybridizing. Sambar is an occasional crop pest in mainland China, notably around the Ailoshan range (J. Fellowes pers. comm. 2008), India (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008), Lao PDR (Duckworth et al. 1999), Myanmar (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008), Sumatra (D. Martyr pers. comm. 2008), and probably throughout its range. There is no evidence that Sambar is a serious crop pest away from the fields directly abutting forests. Nonetheless, crop damage is often stated by affected farmers to lead to a requirement for lethal control. However, the ready market for meat means that this is most probably an excuse for killing that would enthusiastically be undertaken anyway (N.S. Kumar and J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008): it is therefore unlikely that control of crop-degrading animals is a significant cause of the species' decline anywhere in Sambar’s range. Grazing competition with domestic stock seems to be much less of a threat to Sambar than to sympatric Gaur and Chital: in fact the key study quantifying just how serious a threat such competition is in Indian protected areas (Madhusudan 2004) found that it had negligible effects on Sambar densities, presumably because Sambar is an efficient browser. Threats to southern India’s forest ungulates by competition with domestic stock grazing within protected areas are exacerbated where dung is collected for export to adjacent coffee areas. Fuel wood removal may also be at levels sufficient to disrupt nutrient cycles of the habitat (Madhusudan 2005). In the Indian Terai Arc Landscape, lopping of tree branches for cattle fodder is a threat to Sambar as it effectively removes most browsable vegetation from the landscape (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). These are probably more serious concerns for Sambar than is grazing by domestic stock.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

A specimen was discovered in a grave from the late second millennium BC, suggesting that the animal might have been kept as a pet (Prates 2014); the teeth of Dusicyon avus were used in a religions context in some aboriginal sites of Buenos Aires province. According to new radiocarbon evidence, the species would have become extinct about 326-496 years BP (Prevosti et al. 2015), supporting the hypothesis that its disappearance might have happened after the arrival of Europeans. Anecdotal evidence exists from the diaries of 19th century naturalists and explorers of a large canid in Patagonia attributable to Dusicyon avus. Prevosti et al. (2015) found no evidence for hybridization, and proposed that the drivers of the recent extinction of the species were anthropogenic impacts, including hunting and domestic dogs, coupled with climatic change.

In Mpumalanga, for example, only 51% of the grasslands are still natural and not previously ploughed and 40% of the grassland vegetation types are listed as threatened(Lötter 2015). Water abstraction or filling in of wetlands from human settlement and industrial expansion also leads to habitat loss. Similarly, suppression of natural ecosystem processes, such as fire, can also lead to habitat degradation through bush encroachment or loss of plant diversity through alien invasive species, and is suspected to be increasing with human settlement expansion. Overall, 45% of our remaining wetland area exists in a heavily modified condition, due primarily to onsite modification from crop cultivation, coal mining, urban development, dam construction, and overgrazing (and thus erosion) and off-site modifications from disruptions to flow regime and deterioration of water quality (Driver et al. 2012)2) Overgrazing the vegetation around wetlands reduces ground cover and thus leads to decreased small mammal diversity and abundance(Bowland and Perrin 1989, 1993).The expansion of wildlife ranching will have to be monitored in this regard, as game overstocking may also affect wetland condition.3) Climate change is projected to reduce area of occupancy significantly by reducing temperate grasslands and wetland habitats. Climate modelling shows that a 47–61% loss in AOO is expected between 1975 and 2050 depending on the dispersal ability of the species(Taylor et al. 2016). While the model predicts a range shift along the Indian Ocean Coastal Belt, where it occurs narrowly at present, this area is highly developed (Driver et al. 2012) and thus may not provide suitable alternative habitat. Coastal habitat transformation in KwaZulu-Natal is due primarily to sugarcane monocultures, forestry plantations and residential developments. Thus, the future distribution of the species may be severely fragmented, resulting in local extinctions (Taylor et al. 2016). Land-use change and climate change may synergise to cause non-linear and accelerating population decline. For example, trapping data suggest that O. angoniensis has already replaced O. auratus throughout most of the Soutpansberg Mountain range except in the Entabeni area (Taylor et al. 2016). More research is needed to validate these trends in other regions.  The habitat of this species is declining, wetlands are the most threatened ecosystem in South Africa (Driver et al. 2012). The South African National Land-Cover change report found a 32.8% decline in natural wetlands nationally from 1990 – 2013/14, which is a combination of both genuine wetland loss through anthropogenic activities and the generally drier conditions currently that in 1990 (GeoTerraImage 2015). Habitat loss due to land transformation in the surrounding matrix further isolates wetlands from one another and exacerbates the degradation of individual wetlands. For example, sugarcane and forestry plantations are often planted right up to wetlands edges, not respecting the appropriate buffer. In KwaZulu-Natal alone, there an average loss of natural habitat of 1.2% per annum between in 1994 and 2011 from agriculture, plantations, built environments and settlements, mines and dams (Jewitt et al. 2015). Although no specific rates of habitat loss are available, 61% of Mpumalanga’s land surface between 2000 and 2014 have come under pressure from prospecting applications (Lötter 2015). Compounding habitat loss from land-use change is climate change. Projected range shifts under the A2 emission scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change showed increases (O. angoniensis) and decreases (O. auratus) that closely mirrored those expected for the savannah and grassland biomes respectively (Taylor et al. 2016).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Wetlands are the most threatened ecosystem in South Africa (Driver et al. 2012). The South African National Land-Cover change report found a 32.8% decline in natural wetlands nationally from 1990-2013/14, which is a combination of both genuine wetland loss through anthropogenic activities and the generally drier conditions currently that in 1990 (GeoTerraImage 2015).  In the Western Cape, specifically, 31% of all wetlands (plus a 32m buffer) and riparian areas have been transformed/lost to agricultural land use (Pence 2012). Water abstraction or filling in of wetlands from human settlement and industrial expansion also leads to habitat loss. Similarly, suppression of natural ecosystem processes, such as fire, can also lead to habitat degradation through bush encroachment or loss of plant diversity through alien invasive species, and is suspected to be increasing with human settlement expansion. Overall, 45% of our remaining wetland area exists in a heavily modified condition, due primarily to on-site modification from crop cultivation, coal mining, urban development, dam construction, and overgrazing (and thus erosion) and off-site modifications from disruptions to flow regime and deterioration of water quality (Driver et al. 2012).2) Climate change is projected to reduce AOO by 12-24% by 2050 through decreasing habitat suitability (Taylor et al. 2016). Most of these habitat declines will occur in the Western Cape because, while the fynbos component of the Eastern Cape will be heavily reduced, the species is able to persist in thicket habitats and thus its future distribution in this region will be relatively unaltered (Taylor et al. 2016).3) Overgrazing the vegetation around wetlands reduces ground cover and thus leads to decreased small mammal diversity and abundance (Bowland and Perrin 1989, 1993).The expansion of wildlife ranching will have to be monitored in this regard, as game overstocking may also affect wetland condition. Overgrazing and climate change may synergise to cause non-linear and accelerating population decline.

However, even in sacred groves, the future of this species is uncertain, because although the monkeys are considered sacred, the forests themselves are not regarded as sacred, so habitat degradation is ongoing (Elgart 2016). Indeed, the scarcity of forest resources in the region threatens the groves, since the traditional beliefs ruling their management are no longer respected in the face of demand for forest products (S. Gonedelé Bi, pers. obs. 2014). In both Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, more than half the closed forest in the forest reserves has been converted to plantation or farmland, or cleared and left bare (Bitty et al. 2015, Matsuda Goodwin et al. 2016).The combination of habitat loss and intense hunting apparently has already extirpated this species in Burkina Faso (Ginn and Nekaris) and possibly in Nigeria (Ogunjemite 2014), has likely reduced its numbers by >90% in Ghana, and has eliminated populations entirely from all nationally protected areas in Cote d'Ivoire (Matsuda Goodwin et al. 2016). It can still be found in three protected forest in Togo, but has been extirpated in at least one other (Segniagbeto et al. 2016), and the remaining populations of Benin, where as many as six former populations probably no longer exist (Nobime et al. 2011) are tiny.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Heaney pers. comm. 2006).Habitat LossAcerodon jubatus is a known forest specialist based on studies of diet and habitat use (Mildenstein et al. 2005, Stier and Mildenstein 2005, Mildenstein 2012). Vegetative GIS layers and Bat Count surveys show that population sizes (for both A. jubatus and P. vampyrus) correlate closely with available natural forest cover, suggesting bat populations are habitat -limited (Mildenstein 2011, 2012). However, A. jubatus populations are much more sensitive to habitat loss and degradation due to their exclusive use of natural forest compared to Pteropus vampyrus’ included use of agricultural crops and degraded forest areas (Mildenstein 2012).Most (>90%) of Philippines' original old-growth forest cover has been destroyed (Kummer 1992). If current trends continue, no old-growth lowland forest will remain by 2030. Remaining total forest cover in the Philippines is roughly 10-15% secondary forest cover, much of this extant forest occurs above 1,000 m asl, where A. jubatus is unlikely to occur (L. Heaney in litt. 2007). Although there has been a moratorium on logging in the Philippines for over two decades, forest removal is on-going. In Samar and Pangasinan (Luzon), open-cast mines are removing forest cover (M. Pedregosa pers. comm. 2006) and in southwestern Negros, a roost of this species occurs in a copper and gold mining claim area (E. Alcala pers. comm. 2006). The forest area in Subic Bay Watershed Reserve has reduced by housing, commercial and tourist developments (T. Mildenstein, pers. comm. 2012). The roost on Polillo which occurs on privately owned land is also under threat from human disturbance (P. Alviola pers. comm. 2006) and the roost site on Boracay was displaced due to infrastructure development for tourism (M. Lorica pers. comm. 2006). Based on these current rates of deforestation, the future population trend for this species will depend on: 1) the extent of regenerating secondary forest, and 2) the ability of A. jubatus to persist in secondary forest (L. Heaney pers. comm. 2012).HuntingInternational trade data show that previously thousands of individuals of fruit bats were exported annually from the Philippines (Mickleburgh et al. 1992), many of these were likely to be A. jubatus. In 1995, the species were listed with other Pteropodids in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which brought about better enforcement of legislation, and increased efforts by customs in both Guam and the Philippines. The international trade of Philippine fruit bats is now minimal, although not altogether stopped (e.g. recent cases in Guam).Hunting of flying foxes is illegal in the Philippines (except for the few remaining indigenous Aeta communities). However, fruit bat hunting is on-going and largely unregulated throughout the country. Reasons for hunting fruit bats in the Philippines vary. Fruit bats hunting is part of Filipino cultural heritage, and fruit bat meat is valued as a delicacy and/or for its medicinal properties (Cariño et al. 2006, Mildenstein 2012). Fruit bats may also be relied upon as an opportunistic food source for forest workers (Gomez in litt. 2007, T. Mildenstein and S. Stier pers. comm. 2012). Finally, fruit bats are valued for sport hunting and as ‘pulutan’ (any snack eaten while consuming alcohol) (Cariño et al. 2006, Mildenstein 2012). Depending on seasonal demands, local markets for fruit bats occur throughout the Philippines. Specific reports of local trade include on Negros Island, where individual bats can be sold for 15-30 pesos (0.30 -0.60US$) (Cariño et al. 2006), in Davao, Calinan province, Mindanao (N. Ingle pers. comm. 2004), at the mixed species roost at the prison at Sablayan (Mindoro) (H. Garcia pers. comm. 2006). In general, hunters and fruit bat buyers think of A. jubatus as quite odourous compared to P. vampyrus (S. Stier, pers. comm. 2012). In Bataan province and around Subic Bay (Luzon), A. jubatus is less preferred to Pteropus vampyrus because of this quality, but the species look similar, and hunters are generally not aware of which species they are taking (S.C. Stier in litt. 2007).Hunters use lines with hooks (D. Balete pers. comm. 2006, L. Paguntalan pers. comm. 2011), shot guns, rifles, and air guns (T. Mildenstein, pers. comm. 2010, and A. Cariño in litt. 2007). The impact of hunting on fruit bat populations is greatest when it occurs at the roost site, which causes stress and risk of mortality across the entire colony. Species differ in their tolerance of roost site disturbance, with more specialized species expected to be more sensitive. A. jubatus populations exhibit a 12-fold reduction in population density when roost sites are unprotected compared to protected roosts with the same amount of surrounding habitat (Mildenstein 2012). Three roost sites (Boracay, Subic Bay, Luzon, and Mambukal, Negros) are formally protected from hunting by local landowners (Boracay) and the local government (Subic Bay and Mambukal), although occasional hunting is still known to occur at all three locations. At most other roost sites, A. jubatus experiences regular hunting pressure (Mildenstein 2012). Many flying fox colonies have moved from their original roosting sites due to hunting pressure (Mildenstein 2012), (e.g. Patag, Negros Occidental, Calinawan, Negros Oriental,Davao Oriental, Mindanao (A.B. Cariño pers. comm. 2007, Gomez in litt. 2007)).Whether or not the roost site is protected from hunting, a large amount of hunting occurs away from the roosts during night-time foraging in protected and unprotected forests as well as farms kilometres from the roost. Nighttime hunting of bats away from the roost is known to be on-going in Subic Bay (S. Stier and T. Mildenstein pers. comm. 2001, M. Pedregosa-Hospadarsky pers. comm. 2010), Bohol (R. Pamaong-Jose pers. comm. 2011), Bilaran, Leyte (L. Paguntalan pers. comm. 2011), Mt. Malindang (Nuñeza et al. 2006), and Cebu (S. Ramayla pers. comm. 2011), and is likely to occur around all other roost sites containing this species (Mildenstein 2012).Roost site disturbanceThis species has been shown to be especially sensitive to disturbance at the roost site (Van der Aa et al. 2006, Mildenstein 2012). Even the three most-protected roosts, located on Boracay (off Panay Island), Subic (Luzon), Mambukal (Negros Occidental) are not especially protected from disturbance. All three lie within popular tourist areas, where they are subjected to disturbances caused by tourists and guides (e.g. clapping hands or deliberately tapping the roost trees to make them fly). In addition to causing more stress during a period when the bats are normally sleeping, there have been a number of reports of pups that got separated and abandoned due to disturbances at the roost site (Mildenstein 2012). Recent population estimates at these “protected” roosts show smaller populations compared to the 2000-2002 roost counts (Mildenstein 2012).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Baker pers. comm).Habitat change due to livestock grazing (moderate): past declines are thought to relate to changes in habitat structure and suitability for both the bettong and the fungi it consumes; changes were probably influenced by grazing (Bateman and Johnson 2011; Dennis 2001, 2012).Habitat change due to logging (moderate): past declines are thought to relate to changes in habitat structure and suitability for both the bettong and the fungi it consumes; changes were probably influenced by logging (Bateman and Johnson 2011, Dennis 2012).Inappropriate land use (moderate):very little of the range of the Northern Bettong is in National Park, although much of it occurs in State Forest and/or in the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area, managed by the   Department of Environment and Resource Management; State Forest is often managed as a multi-use area which can include timber extraction, water catchment protection, tourism and recreational camping; standard management practices and/or problems associated with these uses may be detrimental to northern bettongs (Dennis 2001); the Coane Range population is largely within the Australian Wildlife Conservancy’s Mount Zero – Taravale wildlife sanctuary, and is managed with the conservation of Northern Bettong as a specific objective.Predation by Red Foxes (potentially catastrophic, but currently not occurring): foxes are not established in the current range of B. tropica, but have occasionally been observed in area; foxes are considered to be the greatest future threat to the species (Dennis 2001, 2012) given their impact on related species.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Their low density means that Cheetah populations require much larger areas of land to survive than do those of other carnivore species, and hence they are particularly sensitive to these pressures which, together, represent the over-arching threat to Cheetah (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Conserving viable subpopulations of Cheetah is likely to require areas of land far in excess of 10,000 km2. Fortunately, Cheetah can thrive in anthropogenically modified landscapes under the right circumstances; hence the landscapes that Cheetah require for their survival may be protected, unprotected, or a combination of the two. Cheetahs also have excellent dispersal abilities (Boast 2014), making it likely to be comparatively easy to maintain gene flow between populations, and to encourage recolonization of suitable unoccupied habitat by conserving connecting habitat.Cheetah living outside protected areas are often threatened by conflict with livestock and game farmers (Marker et al. 2003a, Inskip and Zimmermann 2009, Thorn et al. 2013; Dickman et al. 2014). While Cheetahs tend to prefer wild prey over livestock, they may kill livestock in some circumstances and can be killed by farmers in retaliation (Marker et al. 2003a, Dickman et al. 2014). Conflict with game farmers is widespread as Cheetahs are seen as competitors for valuable game offtake. These conflicts may involve both subsistence pastoralists and commercial ranchers. In many areas Cheetah survival in the face of this conflict is partly due to the fact that they are difficult to kill. They rarely scavenge (Caro 1994, Durant et al. 2010b), hence they are less susceptible to poisoning than are other carnivores such as hyaenas, leopards and lions.Cheetah are highly efficient hunters, and are able to survive in areas of comparatively low prey density (Caro 1994, Durant et al. 2010b, Belbachir et al. 2015). Nevertheless, loss of prey due to hunting, high livestock densities and grazing pressure, and/or habitat conversion may directly impact cheetah populations. Prey loss can also have serious indirect effects, since predation on livestock may become more frequent where wild prey are depleted (Marker et al. 2003b), intensifying conflict with livestock farmers.Cheetah may also become captured in snares set for bushmeat offtake, even though they may not be the primary target (Lindsey et al. 2013). While effects on Cheetah populations are not well quantified, snared Cheetah are reported occasionally and snaring may threaten some subpopulations, particularly when subpopulations are small and isolated.High speed roads also represent a threat to Cheetah populations. This is a particular concern where paved roads cross or adjoin major wildlife areas, such as the Nairobi-Mombasa road which traverses Tsavo National Park in Kenya, and the main road that passes through Khavd Touran Biosphere reserve in Iran. In Iran, out of 27 known Cheetah mortalities between 2005 and 2011 due to various human-causes, at least 11 were killed on roads through Kalmand, Turan, Bafq and Dare Anjir protected areas, making it the major cause of anthropogenic mortality (Iranian Cheetah Society 2013). In separate incidents in 2014 two Cheetahs were hit and terminally injured by cars on the dirt main road through the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, while deaths have also been reported on many other roads including examples in South Africa, Zambia and Kenya. Such mortality could have a significant impact on the viability of small and isolated populations of Cheetah.Unregulated tourism has the capacity to threaten Cheetah populations (Roe et al. 1997). Cheetah are undeniably a key attraction for wildlife tourists from Africa; in Amboseli National Park in Kenya tourists spent 12-15% of their total time spent wildlife viewing observing Cheetah (Roe et al. 1997). Large numbers of tourist vehicles or insensitive tourist behaviour can lead to a number of negative effects such as interference with Cheetahs hunting, scaring Cheetah away from kills to which they are unlikely to return, and separation of mothers from cubs (Henry 1975, 1980; Burney 1980). Cub mortality due to separation from their mother has been reported in the Serengeti National Park and Mara Reserve. A large number of vehicles around a Cheetah can also restrict its view, and there has been an unconfirmed report of a Cheetah being killed by a Lion whose approach was masked by vehicles. There have even been unconfirmed reports of vehicles running over Cheetah cubs in the Mara Reserve in their scramble to get close up photographs.  In contrast, well-regulated tourism can make important contributions to Cheetah conservation, not only by the revenue it generates, but also by raising awareness and increasing political will for conservation (Roe et al. 1997).Although Cheetah can be affected by infectious disease (notably mange within the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, (Caro et al. 1987, Gakuya et al. 2012) and anthrax in Etosha (Turnbull et al. 2004)), the low density of Cheetah mean that infectious disease is unlikely to present a major threat to free-ranging Cheetah populations.Cheetah are hunted in some areas for their skins, and also for cultural uses. Additionally, there is a substantial illegal trade in Cheetah cubs to Gulf states (see Use and Trade).An emerging threat is an increase in resource extraction and extensive infrastructure development, such as mining, oil, pipelines, roads and railways. These developments risk further fragmentation of the remaining Cheetah subpopulations into smaller and smaller subpopulations which may no longer be viable. This has been reported to be a particular problem in Iran (Dehghan 2013).All these threats play some role in most Cheetah subpopulations across Africa. In Eastern, Southern and Western Africa, habitat loss and fragmentation have been identified as a primary threat (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Because Cheetahs occur at low densities, conservation of viable populations requires large scale land management planning; as most existing protected areas are not large enough to ensure the long term survival of Cheetahs (Durant et al. 2010b). In northern Africa and Iran a depleted wild ungulate prey base is a particular concern (Hunter et al. 2007, Durant et al. 2014, Belbachir et al. 2015). While conflict with livestock farmers due to livestock depredation, either perceived or real, is a widespread and serious problem across Cheetah range.While the threats outlined above constitute the proximate causes of Cheetah decline, they are a consequence of many ultimate drivers. These include political constraints such as a lack of land use planning, insecurity and political instability and a lack of awareness or political will to foster Cheetah conservation. Many of the range states where Cheetahs occur suffer from a lack of capacity and financial resources to support conservation, and there is a lack of incentives for local people to conserve wildlife. Meanwhile a lack of environmental awareness, rising human populations, and social changes are leading to ever increasing subdivision of land and subsequent habitat fragmentation. These drivers will also need to be addressed if the immediate threats are to be reduced.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Hunting risk is also likely to affect Impala behaviour, such as change in habitat selection or waterhole attendance (Crosmary et al. 2012). Poaching, livestock development and severe drought were the main factors contributing to the decline of Black-faced Impala (Green and Rothstein 1998, East 1999). The reintroduction of 180 individuals from Kaokoland to the west of Etosha National Park between 1968 and 1971 helped promote the conservation of the Black-faced subspecies, and a few were translocated from Etosha to private game farms in Namibia (Fritz and Bourgarel 2013). However, the introduction of Common Impala to ranches and conservancies neighbouring Etosha National Park may represent a threat to the Black-faced Impala through hybridization. Green and Rothstein (1998) earlier estimated that about one-quarter of all privately owned Black-faced Impala occur in mixed herds with Common Impala. In a recent study, Lorenzen and Siegismund (2004) analysed 127 Black-faced Impala individuals from five subpopulations in Etosha National Park to determine whether any hybridization had taken place within the park, but could not find any definite evidence.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

In Egypt, the availability and distribution of waterholes is likely to be a major factor in the condition of populations, and both may fluctuate from year to year (Amer 1997). Water resources are also scarce in Israel and competition for these resources, along with habitat degradation by contamination of water sources, are major potential threats. High levels of tourists at watering, feeding and birthing sites also threatened the population in Israel (Alkon 1997).Hunting is a threat to the species throughout its range. Poaching definitely occurs in Egypt (Amer 1997) and in Sudan (Nimir 1997), and is implicated in the disappearance of this species from some parts of its range in Egypt (Manlius 2001). Poaching also occurs in Jordan, although this threat has decreased recently (Hays and Bandak 1997). In Saudi Arabia, a general ban on hunting ibex was promulgated in 1979; however, it is difficult to control poaching, especially in remote areas (Habibi and Tatwany 1997). The species is effectively protected from hunting in Israel (Alkon 1997). In Yemen, automatic weapons are owned by many people throughout the country and hunting is probably the greatest threat to the ibex (Shackleton 1997). Habitat loss and degradation threatens the species in much of its range. In Saudi Arabia, Nubian Ibex continue to be threatened by habitat degradation, particularly through the extension of roads, livestock encroachment and other development pressures in and around its remaining refuges (Habibi and Tatwany 1997).  Bedouin access to isolated regions where ibex occur means that the habitat and water resources of otherwise secure populations are threatened.Some predation by leopards (Panthera pardus) has been reported in Israel, and reproductive success and juvenile survival vary from year to year, probably depending largely on the nutritional status of adult females. No significant effects of parasites or diseases have been detected among wild populations (Alkon 1997).  In Jordan, the small size of remaining ibex populations and their isolation from each other is also a cause for concern (Hays and Bandak 1997). In Saudi Arabia, continued displacement and isolation of ibex populations will further limit opportunities for dispersal and genetic interchange between scattered populations (Habibi and Tatwany 1997).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In decreasing order they include: 1) Habitat degradation and loss induced by extremely heavy grazing by livestock (Rubenstein 2010, Low et al. 2009); 2) Competition with livestock, especially over access to water and high quality rangeland (Rowen and Ginsberg 1992; Williams 2002, 2013); 3) Local hunting for meat as well as medicinal and cultural purpose; 4) Disease from contact with unvaccinated livestock, especially with respect to anthrax and babesiosis (Hawkins et al. 2015); 5) Hybridization with plains Zebras, although genes currently only flow from Grevy’s to plains Zebras (Cordingley et al. 2009); 6) Predation (Rubenstein 2010); 7) Anticipated land conversion for resort development and other large-scale initiatives for economic expansion.In Kenya, hunting for skins in the late 1970s was the likely cause of the initial precipitous decline in numbers. Recent data suggest that numbers continued to decline because recruitment was limited by low levels of infant and juvenile survival. This was a result of competition for resources – both food and water – with pastoral people and their domestic livestock (Williams 1998). However, a low level of hunting of Grevy’s Zebra for food and, in some areas, medicinal uses continues (Williams pers. comm. 2002). Furthermore, access to existing water sources continues to decline in some regions and the water supply in critical perennial rivers has been reduced, most notably in the Ewaso Ng’iro River where over-abstraction of water for irrigation schemes has reduced dry season river flow by 90% over the past three decades (Williams pers. comm. 2002).In Ethiopia, the Grevy’s Zebra population was in a declining trend during the last 30 years, due to habitat loss/fragmentation, drought, poaching and potential competition with livestock. Habitat loss, drought and poaching were considered to be the major threats. Illegal killing of Grevy’s Zebra was the primary cause of the decline (Kebede 2013). The Alledeghi Wildlife Reserve population is small and genetically isolated. Initial population genetics research on the mtDNA control region revealed two new haplotypes that so far are not found in any other Grevy’s Zebra populations. The nucleotide diversity levels for both the Alledeghi and the southern Ethiopian populations were extremely low (Kebede et al. 2014).Recently, Muoria et al. (2007) recorded an outbreak of anthrax in the Wamba area of southern Samburu, Kenya, during which more than 50 animals succumbed to the disease. Further research on disease prevalence is revealing that Grevy’s Zebra are a reservoir for Theileria and Babesia (tick borne disease), and the first case of West Nile Virus has been found in one individual; the first detected in a wild equid (Hawkins et al. 2015).

In Zanzibar there has been a substantial amount of deforestation and forest degradation over the last 30 years. Firewood is the primary source of income for a significant proportion of people living near the forest (Ely et al. 2000) and there are few alternative means of income generation. This has led to loss of habitat for Aders' Duiker, but also severe habitat fragmentation.The East African coastal forests (Arabuko-Sokoke and Boni-Dodori forests) experience illegal hunting, with the impact of local subsistence hunting likely to be much higher in the smaller but much more heavily populated Arabuko-Sokoke N.R. (Amin et al. 2015). In the Boni-Dodori landscape, there is widespread deforestation and habitat fragmentation, due to clearance for agriculture and unsustainable use of forest resources, such as for charcoal production (Andanje et al. 2011b). Insecurity affects the whole region which is not safe for visitors (KWS 2013). Poaching has decimated many species in the Kiunga-Boni-Dodori-Conservation Area and livestock incursions into Boni and Dodori N.R.s are frequent, especially during droughts, with livestock brought from Garissa, Mandera and Wajir counties (KWS 2013). Boni and Dodori N.R.s have no management system or management presence, leaving them open to uncontrolled resource use and illegal activities such as poaching; Dodori N.R. has 20% of its area designated as a high-use zone and 37% as low use (KWS 2013). Boni and Lunghi forest reserves are similarly unmanaged and are not clearly demarcated (World Agroforestry Centre 2014). Since 2013, insurgency and counter-insurgency operations have severely affected Boni N.R. in particular, and the impact of numerous soldiers and armed groups is potentially severe.Major agricultural and transport developments in the Tana valley have been proposed—especially the Lamu Port and Lamu-Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport (LAPSSET) corridor—which if implemented are expected to have a considerable impact on the main range of the species.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Predation is the main cause of mortality in some areas (exacerbated by changes in fire regimes that result in more frequent burning), particularly woodland and forest habitats (Maxwell et al. 1996). There have been recent substantial population declines in the Iron Range (Queensland), Cape York Peninsula, and the top end of the Northern Territory associated with the spread of cane toads and land-use changes. For instance, major declines to regional extinction have been reported for Northern Quolls following cane toad invasion on Cape York Peninsula (Burnett 1997). Northern Quolls appear to be particularly susceptible to the poison of cane toads, and are killed when they attempt to kill or consume the toads (Woinarski 2005).

Limited access to drinking water and forage (largely due to competition with livestock) is also a major constraint, with reproductive females and foals less than three-months old most at risk. Hence, it will continue to be important to determine critical water supplies and basic forage requirements, allowing management authorities to determine (in consultation with local pastoralists) how to conserve the African Wild Ass (Kebede 1999, 2007; Moehlman 2002; Teclai 2006; Moehlman et al. 2013).

The effects of drought and extreme weather on small populations has been documented for Przewalski's horses (Equus ferus przewalskii) in Mongolia (Kaczensky et al. 2011), and is currently affecting Grevy's Zebra (E. grevyi) in Kenya (B. Low-MacKaye, pers. comm. 2017). Increasingly sophisticated farming could further disrupt movements through fencing or by preventing access to surface water (Novellie et al. 2002).The greatest current threat to Cape Mountain Zebra is further loss of genetic diversity through inbreeding, caused by small subpopulation sizes and/or small property sizes. New subpopulations have been created through translocation of animals, with all but one of these subpopulations originating from Mountain Zebra National Park (MZNP); the exception being De Hoop Nature Reserve, which consists of individuals from MZNP and Kammanassie Nature Reserve. Two thirds of the entire genotype is therefore located in just two populations (Kammanassie and Gamkaberg Nature Reserve (Moodley and Harley 2005)), while the remaining third comprises MZNP and reintroduced populations. Currently, the South African population of Cape Mountain Zebra is highly fragmented into a large number of small subpopulations yet little metapopulation management is practiced. Founder groups are often small (50% of subpopulations have had a founder population smaller than the recommended 14 animals, Hrabar and Kerley 2015), and genetic exchange between subpopulations is poor (73% of privately-owned subpopulations have only ever had a single introduction event, Hrabar and Kerley 2015), thereby increasing the risk of inbreeding and genetic drift. Vulnerability to disease also increases due to inbreeding. The subpopulations at both Bontebok National Park and Gariep Dam Nature Reserve, which have been shown to be inbred and lack genetic diversity, have both had an outbreak of sarcoid tumours (53% and 22% of the subpopulations, respectively), indicating a general immune system breakdown (Sasidharan 2006, Sasidharan et al. 2011). Development of a metapopulation management plan (and adoption of such plan into provincial and national conservation policy) which incorporates “resource mobilization strategies” (how human and financial resources will be utilized for successful implementation of the plan) is essential in ensuring the long-term survival of Cape Mountain Zebra.Cape Mountain Zebra were once extensively hunted for their skins, because they competed with livestock for grazing, and allegedly because they broke fences (Penzhorn 1988). Today, however, the greatest threat to the Cape subspecies may stem from the risk of hybridization with Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra and Plains Zebra (Dalton et al. 2017). Hybridisation risk also exists for Hartmann’s Mountain zebra: possible hybridisation between mountain zebra and plains zebra (E. quagga burchelli) have been reported for some years in the Otjovasandu area of Etsoha NP where the two species overlap. Recent analysis of faecal DNA (Pauline Kamath pers. comm.) using microsatellite markers in samples of 21 of each species from Otjovasandu supports both hybridization and introgression. However, we do not know it this is part of a normal hybrid zone or if it is an artifact, perhaps caused by the boundary fence artificially keeping the two species in closer contact throughout the year than would be the case if mountain zebra were free to move westward. Hybridisation is also reported between the HMZ and donkeys in Angola (P. vaz Pinto unpubl. data).In Namibia, there is commercial trade in Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra skins. Populations need to be carefully monitored so that harvesting does not adversely affect population viability. However, economical incentives provided through sustainable hunting also help improve prospects of coexistence with cattle farmers who occupy much of the range. Hartmann's Mountain Zebra are reportedly being harvested at a rate of about 2,000-3,000 per year, which may exceed their rate of population growth (e.g., Cape Mountain Zebra in Gamka Mountain Nature Reserve increase at about 5% per year; Watson et al. 2005).A poorly understood, but emerging, threat is that of reintroduced large predators into areas containing subpopulations of Cape Mountain Zebra. This includes Lion (Addo Elephant, Mountain Zebra and Karoo national parks) and Cheetah (MZNP, some private reserves). Data indicate that Cape Mountain Zebra were preferred prey for Lion in Karoo National Park (C. Tambling unpubl. data), and anecdotal evidence suggests that cheetah suppressed population growth in at least one privately-owned population. Further research is needed to assess the extent and implications of this threat.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The primary threats to the species are large scale deforestation and increasingly, hunting. Tapir population have declined by well over 50% in Thailand and Malaysia, whereas it is suspected to be slightly less than 50% in Sumatra. The main reason for declines in the past is habitat conversion, with large tracts land being converted into palm oil plantations. However, increasingly as other large 'prey"" species decline in the area hunters are beginning to look towards tapir as a food source.Destruction of habitat is the main threat to the species throughout its entire range. Whereas recent research suggests that tapirs are not necessarily affected negatively by illegal logging activities (Clements et al. 2012, Traeholt unpubl. data) forest conservation to monocrop plantations such as palm oil has devastating effects on tapirs. Magintan et al. (2012) recorded a strong correlation between the increases in road-kills and plantation development. In Thailand, most remaining intact forest now lies within protected areas, with mostly degraded lands outside. Myanmar's protected areas make up approx. 5% of land area (Shwe) and most tapir habitat lies outside these protected areas. Large-scale habitat destruction has continued in Sumatra, and most remaining habitat in central Sumatra is outside protected areas (Novarino). The population decline in Sumatra is believed to be caused primarily because of the onslaught on suitable habitat. However, the rate of decline seems to diminish during the 2010-2014 period compared to the 2004-2009 period. It is likely correlated with the increasing Global demand for “sustainably” produced palm oil, as well as a US$ 1 Billion REDD-grant provided by  Norway to Indonesia.Tapirus indicus are shy animals and appear to be highly sensitive to forest fragmentation.  In Halabala Wildlife Sanctuary on the Thai-Malaysia border, Kaewsirisuk (2001) found that the species does not venture within a few hundred meters of forest-plantation edges.  At Khao Sok National Park, tapirs are interior forest species that avoid forest edges (Lynam 1996). Kawanishi (2002), however, found in Taman Negara, the largest national park in Malaysia, that although the human traffic level was heavier in area closer to the park boundary, tapirs showed no edge effects.  While forest loss continues in Thailand, forests in protected areas remain relatively stable in size and composition to other countries because of a ban on commercial logging that has been in place since 1989.  For this reason, while tapirs may indeed be threatened in general by forest loss, populations in Thailand and Malaysia are probably more stable. In Malaysia the current forestry trend seems to be stabilized at approx. 43% remaining forest cover (57% lost), of which at least half can be considered tapir habitat. In Thailand, 40% of the remaining forest is outside protected areas and only 5% of Myanmar's land area is protected forest (Lynam pers. comm.).The species has uncertain status and future in Myanmar due to security issues and forest clearance for rubber and oil palm plantations.  However, two new protected areas have been designated in the Tenasserims: Taninthayi National Park and Lenya River Wildlife Sanctuary.  If these areas can be protected, they will preserve valuable tapir habitat in the future.Malay Tapirs are generally not hunted for subsistence or commercial trade in Thailand or Myanmar, since their flesh is considered distasteful. Some hill tribes believe that killing a tapir brings bad luck. In Malaysia deliberate hunting of Malay Tapir for consumption is also rare, because consuming the species is considered “forbidden” by the national Islamic authority. However, most illegal poachers apprehended in Malaysia are from Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand (DWNP unpub. report), and it remains unknown to what extent that they hunt tapirs for consumption and/or other reasons. Previous reported practices in Sumatra of live tapirs being traded through several Indonesian zoos, some destined for private collections or for sale as meat in local markets, seems to have been halted with no new known since 2008 (Novarino pers. comm).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

The impacts of hunting on populations are amplified by the very low ability of tapir to quickly re-populate impacted areas. Though several strongholds occur - populations have been severely reduced and fragmented across the entire Cerrado (Brazil), Chaco (Argentina/ Paraguay), Atlantic forest (Brazil/ Argentina/ Paraguay) and llanos (Venezuela/Colombia) biomes. In Argentina and southern Brazil the species has been extirpated from the tropical and temperate grassland and shrubland - and are rapidly declining in the dry Chaco. Additionally the species has been extirpated from the entire Caatinga biome of north-eastern Brazil.   In the northeast, tapirs are present only inside protected areas where illegal hunting is minimal. Outside protected areas, they are still hunted, chased by dogs, and negatively impacted by competition with cattle and illegal timber activities. The species is in rapid decline along the eastern Amazon and its Southern Tributaries where extensive hunting and deforestation have reduced almost all large mammal populations. In addition, populations are declining rapidly along the agricultural front spreading into western Brazil and along the Andean foothills of Ecuador and Colombia.  In Argentina, T. terrestris has disappeared from around 50% of its original distribution, as a consequence of deforestation, hunting and livestock activity. The species is absent in many areas of transition between the montane forests, in important sectors of the Chaco and the Atlantic forest and completely in the Espinal. However, there are still populations in good condition in some forested areas, mainly those with limited accessibility and human activities, such as mountain forests or protected areas with strict controls. There is currently an important effort to reintroduce the species in the province of Corrientes (Esteros del Iberá).  Roadkill is becoming a major threat to Tapir in the Cerrado (Brazil), the Pantanal (Brazil), and the Atlantic Forest (Argentina/Brazil) (P. Medici pers.comm, D. Varela in litt.). In Bolivia, tapirs are susceptible to hunting, and habitat degradation. While they may well be more common than expected in protected areas, as was found out in Costa Rica and elsewhere for T. bairdii, they do not fare well in the presence of hunting. In French Guiana, tapirs are regularly hunted and sold commercially for meat in markets and restaurants. Little information is available for the population in Guyana, however, tapirs are not protected there at present and are hunted by subsistence hunters as well as by a developing bush-meat industry as roads are cut into the forest for logging. In Paraguay a recent threatened species workshop assessed the Lowland Tapir as ""Vulnerable A2ac"" mainly due to habitat loss in the last 40 years, and the resulting decline in the distribution and population of the species.  More than 90% of the Atlantic Forest has been lost, and the Chaco could experience the same declines over the next 30 years. Hunting and habitat loss were identified as main threats to the species.  In conclusion it is difficult to calculate the overall impact of hunting on populations, but we can infer from previous studies that in the past 30 years extensive and ongoing habitat loss combined with hunting and accumulated indirect threats have been much greater than previously estimated, and much greater than would be suspected by looking at maps of remaining forest in the Amazon.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

Its roosts tend to be well protected from bushfires and it is able to survive in landscapes with severely depleted natural food supplies as long as alternative plants are available (Ratrimomanarivo 2007). Hunting is therefore the main threat and was reported to account for a 30% desertion rate from 60 roosts (MacKinnon et al. 2003). Although hunters report that deserted roosts are recolonized after a few years, there are several confirmed examples where this species has been extirpated at roost sites (MacKinnon et al. 2003).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The restricted range of the Zanj Sun Squirrel is under serious threat of near complete (>95%) loss due to climate change and forest degradation (Peterson and Martínez-Meyer 2007). Despite local protection, the sacred Three Sisters Cave site (where the species has been observed) is still threatened by the needs of the growing local population. Cutting of trees for fuel and timber as well as coral block mining are common in the vicinity of the site (Metcalfe et al. 2009).

Additionally, hybridization with adjacent species poses a threat to some populations (Molur et al. 2003). Although it has a wide distribution, the species is considered to be threatened in most parts of its range. Habitat destruction is the primary cause of the decline. Habitat destruction poses the greatest risk to this species in northeastern India (Srivistava and Mohnot 2001). However, it has been hunted in the Himalayan regions of North Bengal, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh, where it frequently invades crops (Srivistava and Mohnot 2001). Locals use skulls as an “evil eye” in front of houses in northeastern India (Das pers. comm.). There has been extensive habitat loss over the last 15 years in several states of northeastern India (from 30-60%), with major impacts on M. a. assamensis. The Nepal population of Macaca assamensis is threatened due to its restricted distribution of less than 2,200 km2 extent of occurrence and 914 km2 area of occupancy and continuing decline in area, extent and quality of habitat, the number of locations and in the number of mature individuals—the latter two conditions being inferred from threats to habitat and population from degradation and hunting, respectively. Given its restricted extent of occurrence, threats on its population and habitat, and small numbers in fragmented patches, the Nepal population of this macaque is categorized as Endangered.In Thailand habitat loss is the primary threat, hunting for food less so (R. Boonratana pers. comm.). It is protected only in temples.  In eastern Myanmar habitat loss is the primary threat, but hunting is presumed to occur. They are hunted to make footwear, and the skins are taken to Tibet as it is more profitable than taking it to Yunnan province of China. In northern Myanmar, hunting and habitat loss due to conversion are the major threats. There is more than 30% decline in forest cover over the last 30-35 years. The combination of habitat loss and hunting heavily impacts the subpopulations, and the threats are likely to continue in the next three decades if the demand for this continues in Tibet (S. Htun pers. comm.).In Lao PDR and Viet Nam the primary threat is hunting for food and for bones to make balm and/or glue. The bones are not used within Lao PDR, but sold to Viet Namese and traders within Lao PDR. The balm is used for pain relief and other speculative “medicinal” purposes. The trade also goes into China (R. Boonratana pers. comm.). This species has declined in Viet Nam and Lao PDR in the last 30-35 years by more than 30%, and is expected to continue to decline in the future.In Tibet the habitat is good, but there is some hunting, and no detailed data exists for M. a. pelops from that region of China (Z. Zhou et al. pers. comm.). For M. a. assamensis, hunting is a major threat. Logging has ceased, but was a major threat for the last 30 years. Conversion to pastures is still ongoing, but not a significant threat. There are extensive habitats still left for this subspecies and the taxon is relatively safe.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Hunting and the effects of introduced carnivores are less likely to be driving population declines. The species was considered forest-dependent by Wemmer and Watling (1986), and no subsequent information contradicts this. Ongoing fragmentation of forest can be assumed to expose an ever-higher proportion of the population to retaliatory killing; it is a documented predator of livestock, with three of six conflicts investigated by Wemmer and Watling (1986) resulting in lethal control of the Sulawesi Civet in question.In North Sulawesi, the impact of hunting on this species is probably low. No information was traced for other parts of the island, and given that ethnic groups may differ in their consumption patterns, the situation in North Sulawesi should not be assumed to hold for the rest of the island. Wemmer and Watling (1986) found no evidence around Lore Lindu that Sulawesi Civet is specifically sought for food, and plenty of circumstantial evidence that it is not. Various more recent market trade and village consumption surveys in North Sulawesi corroborate this. In 2011 surveys of wildlife meat in north Sulawesi markets by Selamatkan Yaki, a programme through Whitley Wildlife Conservation Trust (UK), did not find the species (T.A.C. Loffeld pers. comm. 2015). Two years of extensive trade surveys in North Sulawesi province in 2001–2003 detected nearly 7,000 wild mammals in road blockades of which fewer than 100 were (in total) small bats (Chiroptera), babirusas Babyrousa, macaques Macaca, cuscuses Phalanger and Stigocuscus, and civets, and almost 100,000 wild mammals in markets, of which only 1.2% were (in total) cuscuses, squirrels (Sciuridae), babirusas, macaques, tarsiers Tarsius, civets, anoas Bubalus, and deer Rusa timorensis (Lee et al. 2005). Similar surveys continued, and up to 2006 there seems to have been no record of Sulawesi Civet in any year (Wildlife Conservation Society per M. Leggett pers. comm. 2015). However, in 2007 one Sulawesi Civet was reported in a truck-load of wildlife meat inspected in Maelang, North Sulawesi province; the consignment was confiscated and buried (J. Tasarin pers.comm. 2015). In 2003, S. Siwu (pers. comm. 2015) photographed parts (including head and paws) of a Sulawesi Civet in Maeleng market. Based on almost continuous market surveys in Tomohon and Langowan from 2000 to 2014, L. Clayton (pers. comm. 2015) considers it to be, at most, rarely traded.The Minahasans do not usually seek the species for consumption; their order of preferred wildlife meat is, in general, Sulawesi Wild Pig (Sus celebensis), fruit bats (Megachiroptera), white tailed forest rats (Rattus spp.), Reticulated Python (Python reticulatus), macaques, Water Monitor (Varanus salvator), cuscuses, and anoas. Less preferred species such as babirusas, civets, Maleo (Macrocephalon maleo) (meat) or tarsiers, if they are trapped or shot by hunters, may be sent opportunistically to market (J. Tasarin pers. comm. 2015). This is corroborated by intensive surveys of village consumption by the Selamatkan Yaki programme in 2011–2015. These found only four respondents stating that they had eaten or kept ‘musang’ (which could also refer to Malay Civet (Viverra tangalunga), or, if present, Common Palm Civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus)) as a pet. Although if another name were used for Sulawesi Civet, records of consumption would not have been picked up, this suggests a low incidence of in-village consumption in the surveyed areas. In 2011–2012, villages were spread through North Sulawesi: Agotey (Pineleng), Kumu (Tombariri), Wawona (Tatapaan), Paslaten (Tomohon Timur), Tinoor (Tomohon Utara), Rurukan (Tomohon Timur), Pangolombian (Tomohon Selatan), Molas (Bunaken), Kawatak (Langowan Selatan), Kasawari (Aertembaga), Airmadidi (Airmadidi), Pinilih (Dimembe), Dua Sudara (Ranowulu), Kombot (Pinolosian), Lolak (Lolak), Tudo Aog (Boloang), Liberia (Modayag), Sinsingon (Passi Timur) and Tondey (Motoling Barat); in each village 40 respondents were interviewed, resulting in 760 respondents. In 2013, there were 781 respondents in Tomohon and Langowan, in 2014, 1,135 in Airmadidi and Bitung, and in 2015, 764 in Tomohon and Langowan. No respondents mentioned that the eating of any animal was culturally avoided (T.A.C. Loffeld, H. Hilser and V. Melfi pers. comm. 2015). In these areas, most hunting is believed to be with ground snares, nets and dogs (J. Tasarin pers. comm. 2015, L. Clayton pers. comm. 2015, T.A.C. Loffeld pers. comm. 2015). Sulawesi Civet is believed to be largely arboreal (Wemmer and Watling 1986) and thus is might be at low risk from these methods. There is considerable arboreal snaring for rats, but the nooses are too small to catch Sulawesi Civet except by a limb; air-gun hunting perhaps would result in most animals taken (J. Tasarin pers. comm 2015).Live wildlife markets on Java and Bali trade many civets, including those from Indonesian islands other than Java; no Sulawesi Civet has been noted in these surveys (Shepherd 2012, Nijman et al. 2014, V. Nijman pers. comm. 2015), nor have any come to the Cikananga rescue centre in Java, which has received other Sulawesi species (W. Eggen pers. comm. 2015). There are some ‘civet-lover clubs’ on Sulawesi but whether a significant number of members keep captive Sulawesi Civet has not been established; their internet content does, however, include advice on how to keep it (V. Nijman pers. comm. 2015). If civet-keeping were to rise dramatically in popularity there (as it has on Java; Nijman et al. 2014), and this species were to become a sought-after holding, then given the assumed low population of this species, targeted off-take might substantially exacerbate the rate of decline.Non-native species of civet (Malay Civet and Common Palm Civet) and domestic cats and dogs might threaten Sulawesi Civet. However, given that it apparently is quite arboreal, none is likely to be a significant predator and the only likely strong competitor might be Common Palm Civet; but this species is scarce (probably not in fact naturalised) on Sulawesi (Wemmer and Watling 1986, Veron 2001). Moreover, on Buton island dogs and cats live in the forest only near villages and roads (Seymour et al. 2010); assuming this is true also for the mainland, they perhaps have little contact with Sulawesi Civet.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The main factors operating the extinction have been (1) habitat loss, (2) over-exploitation and (3) impact of alien American Mink.In the European continent, human activities have resulted in large-scale alteration of landscapes, which has had a substantial impact on various habitats and their species. The European Mink has proved to be sensitive to human-induced environmental change and disturbance. As the type and extent of human influence on the species and its biotope has varied in time and between regions in Europe, also the set of factors contributing to the extinction has varied.Several factors have often been acting in concert with a cumulative effect. The course of decline during the first half of 20th century in central regions of Russia is a perfect illustration of this. There, the effect of over-exploitation was noticed almost throughout the entire European Mink range (this even resulted in a moratorium of hunting in several regions and even in reinforcement efforts in Yaroslavl Region, where around 130 European Minks were translocated with the hope to recover the original, depleted population). In addition, extensive change of habitats in the mid-20th century further contributed to the decline. Thereafter, the invasion of the American Mink posed a very serious threat to the native mink. Large-scale introductions of American Mink in Russia, first planned to be conducted only in regions outside the European Mink's natural range, were ultimately performed also inside the native mink range. The reason for this was twofold: (1) the original mink has become too scarce for the fur-trapping industry, (2) higher value of American Mink fur in the market (Pavlov and Korsakova 1973). In these times, the American Mink and European Mink were not regarded by the relevant authorities to be two distinct species. In the course of the introduction operation, 20,400 American Mink were released in the USSR until 1971, with around 4,000 of them being released into the range of the European Mink (Pavlov and Korsakova 1973). The intentional introduction of the alien species was strongly supported by rapidly developing mink fur-farming in the Soviet Union – escapees from farms formed a continuous source of new founders for introduction. American Mink farming started in the 1920s; in 1972, 1.9 million female American Minks were kept in fur-farms and in 1973, 4.9 million minks were raised in 146 farms in the former Soviet Union (Abramov 1974). As the native mink populations were small and highly fragmented by over-exploitation and habitat loss, the fur-farm escapees, being ecologically more flexible (Maran 1991) easily invaded into the freely available ecological niche, thus making it impossible for the depleted European Mink to recover. Even more, the remaining European Mink groups were an easy target for intra-guild aggression (Maran et al. 1991, 1998; Sidorovich et al. 1999, 2001). The magnitude of the effect of mink farming on the native mink is well illustrated by a recent study in Denmark (a country with a very high number of mink farms), which concludes that 86% of free-living American Minks are escapees from farms (Hammershoj et al. 2005).Local key factors have changed with time also in many other countries. For instance the impact of over-hunting and/or habitat change weakened the populations and accelerated the impact of the subsequent spread of the American Mink and/or the impact of other factors. It might well be that sometimes the interchange of key factors in time and/or the concurrent impact of several factors has led to a synergistic effect on the European Mink. Further, the time from the introduction of the threat to the extinction of the species can be highly variable, resulting in the so-called extinction or decline lag (Baillie et al. 2004). This, along with the interwoven effect of numerous factors, is likely to result in situations when it is hard or, in some cases, even impossible to identify the actual causes behind the extinction process.The role of the alien American Mink deserves a special attention. Its role has been noted in several reports as a secondary or unimportant factor, usually emphasising that the decline of the European Mink started before the invasion of American Mink (Lodé 2002, Lodé et al. 2001, Rozhnov 1992, Schubnikova 1982). Still, there are several records of local extinction of the European Mink concurrent with rapid expansion of the American Mink, e.g., in Estonia, Tver Region in Russia, Basque country (Zadorra river basin and Cantabric rivers in Bizkaia province) in Spain, Belarus (Maran 1991, Sidorovich 1991, 1993; Katchanovsky 2002, Palazón et al. 2002, 2004; Põdra et al. 2013, Zuberogoitia et al. 2013, A Gomez pers. comm, 2014). The former range of European Mink included a number of large nature reserves where habitat alteration and hunting were minimal or absent (Maran et al, 1998, Maran 1992). Further, although there are 'time-shot' records on the co-existence of the two mink species, no records demonstrating long-term sympatric coexistence of the two mink species have been found. Numerous records reveal the local replacement of the European Mink with the American Mink, but no opposite events have been reported. Records on replacement of the European Mink with the American Mink are further supported by studies of behavioural interactions between the two mink species in the wild and well as in experimental conditions. All this evidences that the American Mink has played a special role in the demise of the European Mink. While most of the other agents which have been operating the extinction are relatively easy to stop by conventional conservation management, there is very little one can do to prevent the spread of the alien American Mink. This means that the presence of the American Mink in wide territories across Europe makes the efforts for species recovery a very complicated task.A new complication is the rising trend for private individuals in France to keep American Mink as a pet.In addition to the main factors behind the decline of European Mink populations, a number of other factors may pose local threat the remaining small populations, like hybridisation, road casualties, Aleutian disease and secondary poisoning.Habitat loss and degradation is still a serious threat especially in western populations, both in France and in Spain (mostly in Cantabric rivers).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

It is estimated that currently around 95% of rhino horn sourced in Africa for end user illegal markets in SE Asia are from this source (Emslie et al. 2019). Rhino horn has traditionally had two main uses: use in Chinese medicine, and ornamental use. Recently rhino horn has become a highly prized material for making carved expensive high-status items such bowls and bangles. In the past it was also used to produce ornately carved handles for ceremonial daggers (jambiyas) worn in Yemen and some Middle East countries. Historically rhino horn was also used in traditional Chinese medicine (as a fever reducer). However, most recently it appears to be shavings from carvings that are illegally sold to the medicinal market at lower prices than worked items. Until recently, at the continental species level, poaching of White Rhinos has not had a serious impact on overall numbers of White Rhinos in Africa, with poaching losses in parts of the range being surpassed by encouraging growth rates in others. However following declines in the largest subpopulation (Greater Kruger) continental numbers declined by an estimated 15% from 2012 to 2015. While poaching levels increased dramatically from 2007 to 2014, numbers of White Rhinos reported poached have declined in each of the four years every year since, and half year reported poaching in 2019 in the major Range State, South Africa indicates this trend is possibly continuing. See attached Supplementary Material for graphs of reported poaching numbers by year.The significantly increased poaching since 2007 has greatly increased protection costs and risks to investment and staff. This has resulted in declining live sale prices and reduced incentives. Some private owners in South Africa have got rid of their rhino. If this worrying trend continues this threatens to possibly reverse the expansion of range and has the potential to also significantly reduce conservation budgets (due to declining live sales at lower prices). However, so far there appears to be a consolidation of White Rhino into larger subpopulations. For more information on threats see the joint IUCN/TRAFFIC rhino report for CITES CoP18 (Emslie et al. (2019) http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf).Poaching and civil wars in both Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighbouring South Sudan had a devastating impact on Northern White Rhino. Whilst poaching pressure initially increased during civil unrest and war in the late 1990s, good reproduction enabled the population to remain relatively stable. However, since 2003, poaching escalated and the population declined rapidly with 11 carcasses found in a three-month period between March and May 2004. Confirmed numbers of Northern White Rhino fell from 30 individuals in April 2003 to just four in August 2005. No live rhino have been seen since 2006 or signs of live rhino (spoor or dung) reported since 2007 despite intensive systematic foot surveys. It is believed that the Northern White Rhino has probably gone extinct in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Rumours persist of possible survivors in war-torn South Sudan, but as yet there has been no conclusive evidence of this being the case. ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Ingram et al. (2018) estimate that 0.4–2.7 million pangolins are hunted each year in Central African forests and that this number has increased by 150% over the past four decades. Although no formal evaluation has yet to be made, the majority of these are believed to be White-bellied Pangolins (P. tricuspis). The 2.3-fold increase in the price of Phataginus spp. between 1990 and 2015 across urban markets in Central and West Africa (Ingram et al. 2018) may indicate an increase in demand and/or that arboreal species have become harder to obtain. The species has been reported in international trade (Bräutigam et al. 1994, Chaber et al. 2010, Mwale et al. 2017, Heinrich et al. 2017, Ingram et al. 2019). According to CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) trade reports for the period 1996–2011, trade in live animals, specimens or skins is reported in nearly every year, with 40 specimens exported from the Central African Republic in 2000 (www.cites.org). As with other African pangolin species, exploitation of black-bellied pangolins for Asian markets is believed to be increasing (Challender and Waterman 2017). The species is included in international trafficking to Asian markets: it is estimated that between 2015 and 2019 >400,000 African pangolins were seized either in Africa bound for Asia, or in Asia (Challender et al. 2019; D. Challender, unpubl. data).  Hunters in Gabon report that Asian industry workers requested meat from all three pangolin species in Gabon (including Black-bellied Pangolins). Pangolins were sought after more than any other species (Mambeya et al. 2018).Habitat loss is also a threat. Past and present declines in pangolin area of occupancy (AOO) and habitat quality likely differ between West and Central Africa. West Africa had deforestation rates of 0.9% between 1990 and 2000 and 0.3% between 2000 and 2010 (Mayaux et al. 2013). In 2018, the Democratic Republic of the Congo had the second highest loss of tropical primary forest in the world, and Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire ranked 1st and 2nd in terms of their percent increase in loss from 2017 at 60% and 26% respectively (of countries with >100,000 ha of primary forest; World Resources Institute 2019). West Africa also presently has higher human population densities (Tatem 2017), and smaller patches of roadless areas (Ibisch et al. 2016). Annual deforestation is higher in areas with higher human population density (Mayaux et al. 2013), however true rates of decline are imperfectly known. Evidence of a general drying trend, particularly in the upper Congolese forests (Zhou et al. 2014), may exacerbate the situation through possible changes in vegetation species composition and structure that may result in decreased habitat suitability for Black-bellied Pangolins.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

While known to occur in a number of protected areas throughout its range, White-bellied Pangolins are subject to widespread and often intensive exploitation for bushmeat and traditional medicine and are by far the African pangolin species most frequently found in bushmeat markets.  White-bellied Pangolins are increasingly being hunted in protected areas due to the species largely being extirpated outside of protected areas in many regions (Boakye et al. 2016). An estimated 0.4–2.7 million pangolins are hunted each year in Central African forests, and this figure has increased by 150% over the past four decades (Ingram et al. 2018), although the annual harvest rate is likely to be closer to 420,000 individuals per annum as was also estimated by Fa and Peres (2001). Fa et al. (2006) report that during six months of fieldwork in Cameroon in 2002–2003, the White-bellied Pangolin was the fourth most harvested species across 47 sites sampled, after the Brush-tailed Porcupine (Atherurus africanus), Blue Duiker (Philantomba monticola) and Giant Pouched Rat (Cricetomys emini). Similarly, in a study in Equatorial Guinea around the village of Sendje (including within Monte Alén National Park), it was the fifth most common mammal species in terms of offtake after the Blue Duiker, Brush-tailed Porcupine, Black Colobus (Colobus satanus) and Giant Pouched Rat (Kümpel 2006). Bräutigam et al. (1994) report that despite pangolins being one of the least commonly sold meats (less than 5% of overall sales) consumer demand for pangolins is high in Gabon, with White-bellied Pangolin meat being the third most requested item at bushmeat markets. The price of White-bellied Pangolins across urban markets in Central and West Africa has increased by 2.3 times between 1990 and 2015 (Ingram et al. 2018). These trends suggest increased demand for the species and/or indicate that White-bellied Pangolins are harder to obtain, probably as a result of population declines. The number of pangolins hunted and sold for traditional medicine and cultural practices is huge and most likely unsustainable considering the reproductive biology of this species (Ingram et al. 2018). For example, Soewu and Ayodele (2009) reported a total of 178 whole White-bellied Pangolins being sold for traditional medicine amongst the Ijebus of Ogun State, southwestern Nigeria between April and July 2007, which averaged 1.06 carcasses per dealer per month. Sodeinde and Adedipe (1994) also noted that pangolins used in traditional medicine in south-western Nigeria are exclusively White-bellied Pangolins, the Black-bellied Pangolin (P. tetradactyla) being much rarer. Pregnant female and juvenile pangolins are preferred for some practices (D. Soewu, unpubl. data). White-bellied Pangolins are frequently recorded in international trade (Bräutigam et al. 1994, Challender and Hywood 2012, Challender and Waterman 2017, Heinrich et al. 2017, Krishnasamy and Shepherd 2017, Mwale et al. 2017, Ingram et al. 2018, 2019) and according to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) trade data, in the period 1985–2015. This includes the trade in live animals: in 2016, 46 live White-bellied Pangolins were imported to the USA from Togo for zoological purposes. Between 2013 and 2015, 2,010 kg of White-bellied Pangolin scales (which equates to approximately 5,576 individuals) were traded. These include 1,950 kg from Congo to China, 950 kg from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to China (2014–2015) and 60 kg from Togo to Hong Kong SAR (though export data shows only 30 kg of scales exported from Togo during this period (Challender and Waterman, 2017). The scale of illegal international trade, in particular to Asian markets, is much greater, and is a major threat to the species. Challender et al. (2019) estimate that between 2015 and 2018 scales from approximately 200,000 African pangolins were seized either in Africa bound for export or en route to Asian markets. There is also evidence that tropical African pangolins including this species are being specifically targeted at the point of harvest for their scales for illicit export, i.e. as opposed to being a by-product of the bushmeat trade (O. Drori, pers. comm.). Heinrich et al. (2017) observed that of all large-quantity pangolin scale shipments (weighing 1,000 kg or more) between 2010–2015, 55% were found to originate in Africa and these large-quantity shipments accounted for 60% of all scales traded. Furthermore, both the frequency and weight of large-quantity scale shipments increased through this period (Heinrich et al. 2017). Documented pangolin seizures undoubtedly account for only a small fraction of actual trafficking levels owing to low detection rates associated with wildlife trade (Challender and Hywood 2012) and thus the actual illegal trade levels are likely to be higher. Challender and Hywood (2012) report that in 2011 one confiscated consignment comprised 100 White-bellied Pangolin skins (with scales attached) that had originated in Guinea and was bound for Thailand. Past and ongoing habitat loss and degradation is the second main threat. In West Africa in particular, there have been severe losses of forest habitat in recent decades: annual losses were 0.9% between 1990 and 2000 0.3% between 2000 and 2010 (Mayaux et al. 2013). In 2018, the Democratic Republic of the Congo had the second highest loss of tropical primary forest in the world, and Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire ranked 1st and 2nd in terms of their percent increase in loss from 2017 at 60% and 26% respectively (of countries with >100,000 ha of primary forest; World Resources Institute 2019). West Africa also presently has higher human population densities (Tatem 2017), and smaller patches of roadless areas (Ibisch et al. 2016). Annual deforestation is higher in areas with higher human population density (Mayaux et al. 2013), however true rates of decline are imperfectly known. Although the White-Bellied Pangolin appears able to adapt to some degree of habitat modification, this is not well understood and comparative ecology research is needed between natural forest and modified landscapes. ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The primary threats to this species include native predators, ecosystem modification arising from post-logging forest succession, and longer term predicted habitat loss associated with climate change. Logging activities adjacent to colonies have created temporarily attractive habitat to marmots and have undoubtedly resulted in an increase in marmot populations. Bryant (1990), however, feared that logging clearcuts may be deleterious in the long run; there is evidence that, although they provide attractive summer habitat, they offer poor conditions for successful hibernation. They may thus act as ""sinks"" preventing dispersing marmots from reaching adjacent mountain ridges (Bryant 1996). This would decrease genetic outcrossing as well as preventing former colony sites from being recolonized. More research is needed. Bryant (1990) concluded that the known population of M. vancouverensis is not viable using existing criteria.Bryant and Page (2005) concluded that predation was the proximate cause of recent declines in wild Vancouver Island marmot populations, that losses were highly concentrated in late summer, and that previous studies exaggerated the importance of winter mortality. We suggest that high predation rates were associated with forestry and altered predator abundance and hunting patterns. Habitat loss due to natural cycles and clear cutting of forests as well as an increase in predation present threats to this species, and has caused existing populations to be unstable (Kruckenhauser et al. 2008).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

This species is also threatened by afforestation of Highveld grasslands (Armstrong and van Hensbergen 1996b); for example, Mpumalanga has already lost at least 9% of its natural vegetation to forestry plantations (Lötter et al. 2014). Mining is also a major ongoing cause of habitat loss, where 25% of the surface of Mpumalanga is under mining application (Lötter et al. 2014), most of which is coal mining.It appears as if this species has adapted to a mosaic of disturbances, such as that brought about through patch burns (through natural vegetation fires) and/or overgrazing (perhaps from when herds were migratory across the Highveld). Even in formally protected areas, most of these disturbances are managed, thereby prohibiting natural fluctuations. Suppression of fire is thus suspected to be the next most severe threat, as the microhabitats that the species requires are not created or recycled. Although Coetzee and Monadjem (2008) list grazing pressure as contributing to habitat loss, data from Lesotho indicate that the species occurs in overgrazed areas (Avenant 2011, N.L.

It appears to be a forest-dependent species, and thus the rapid conversion of Sumatran forest to agricultural land is a significant and immediate threat. From 1990-2010, Sumatra lost 7.54 million ha of primary forest, roughly 70% of the total forest cover (Margano et al. 2012). The current distribution of the Sumatran Striped Rabbit is potentially restricted to Bukit Barisan and Kerinci Seblat National Parks, both of which have continued to experience significant encroachment and deforestation within park boundaries. Between 2000 and 2015, Kerinci and Bukit Barisan lost 258 km² and 143 km² of forest respectively (McCarthy, unpub. data). Protected areas in Sumatra are also increasingly isolated from each other by habitat loss and development, raising issues of population fragmentation if there is a loss of connectivity along the Barisan mountain range. There is no evidence that hunting or capture for the pet trade poses a significant threat to the Sumatran Striped Rabbit, likely owing to its rarity and difficulty to catch.

Populations introduced into a large fenced reserve at Scotia from which foxes and cats are excluded increased rapidly to high numbers, but subpopulations released outside those fences collapsed in the presence of low densities of foxes (S. Legge pers. comm. 2014). Modelling of the Taunton population demonstrated that predation of juveniles by feral Cats was sufficient to cause decline (Fisher et al. 2000).

Shekelle pers. comm. 2010). Riley (2002), however, did not think that habitat loss was a major threat, given their presence in a variety of secondary habitats. This discrepancy emphasizes the need to determine the suitability of secondary habitats for sustainable tarsier populations.

Due to past forest management there is a current dearth of available live hollow-bearing trees within Yellow-Bellied Glider habitats. Remaining hollow-bearing trees are therefore an important resource, but these are at risk of collapse due to regular prescribed burning regimes and windthrow. In Queensland and New South Wales (and possibly Victoria) broad-scale land clearing had been stopped due to newly introduced vegetation management legislation However, in Queensland relaxation of this legislation during the last three years has resulted in a sharp increase in forest clearing since 2013 (see https://theconversation.com/land-clearing-in-queensland-triples-after-policy-ping-pong-38279). The effects of this recent change on Queensland populations of the Yellow-bellied Glider have not yet been specifically evaluated, but they are potentially significant. Furthermore, degradation to existing habitat (e.g., through fire, timber removal) within the habitat of isolated populations, but also between non-isolated populations, is a major threat to the species (essentially inducing a fragmentation effect) throughout its range, due to its wide-ranging and extensive habitat requirements (Woinarski et al. 2014).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Predation by introduced foxes and competition with introduced goats are likely to be the greatest threats. Foxes prey on young rock wallabies and probably limit dispersal as well as recruitment. Introduced dogs and cats are also probably threats, but the habitat in which this species lives is not well suited to these predators. Habitat fragmentation and land clearance between colonies is also thought to limit dispersal and reduce numbers of individuals by exposing rock wallabies to higher rates of predation. As colony isolation increases so does the risk of inbreeding (Hazlitt et al. 2006a,b). Hunting was perhaps the main historical factor in reducing the population and range of this species. A sustained commercially-driven period of hunting led to the decline of many populations and local extinctions, and may have been the primary cause of the initial decline, at least in central and southern New South Wales. Bounties were paid on over half a million rock-wallabies between 1894 and 1914 (Short and Milkovits 1990) and there was an extensive fur trade from pre-1890 to 1927 (Lunney et al. 1997). The species was also hunted extensively in the Grampians area of Victoria. The magnitude of hunting is apparent when one considers that the current population of the species is estimated at between 15,000 and 30,000 individuals, and in 1908 alone 92,590 skins were marketed by a single company (Lunney et al. 1997).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Lowe’s Monkeys are hunted as food for personal consumption and for the bushmeat trade, and their loud vocalizations make them an easy target for hunters. A recent market survey indicated that C. lowei and Perodicticus potto are now the two top primate species found in bushmeat markets in Côte d’Ivoire (Gonedelé Bi et al. 2017), in part reflecting the scarcity of other species. The monkeys are also captured as pets, both in live-traps as adults or as young when the mother is killed for the meat trade.Habitat loss and fragmentation due to conversion of forests and farmbush into cocoa, palm oil and rubber plantations is an almost equally important threat to this species. Since 2000, Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana have lost 17% and 13% respectively of their forest cover (Global Forest Watch 2019). Between 1988 and 2007, at least 23,000 km² of the Upper Guinean rainforest in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana were cleared for cocoa farms, and the clearing of forests for cocoa production continues in both countries. In Côte d’Ivoire, the annual deforestation rate between 2000 and 2015 was estimated to be 2.69%, with an average forest loss of 2,500 km²/year (BNETD 2016), and many of the ~180 forest reserves in the geographic range of C. lowei have already been converted into plantations and human settlements. In some parts of Ghana, surface mining for gold, diamonds, bauxite and other metals also threatens the species’ survival, even in farmbush areas (E.

Populations underwent drastic declines in the 1980s. Commercial hunting of the species largely took place to supply the export demand for fruit bats as a luxury food item in Guam and the Northern Marianas. However, this is no longer a threat to the species, because it was listed on Appendix I of CITES in 1990, and international trade in this species is effectively illegal. Hunting of bats for the domestic market appears to have increased in Samoa and American Samoa since the 1980s, and is still a concern today (A. Brooke pers. comm.). In Fiji, the hunting of this species is only for local consumption and is not a major threat to the species, particularly on large islands (Palmeirim et al. 2005). However, if Fijians either begin to hunt flying foxes with guns or to collect for trade the threat of overexploitation could become serious (Palmeirim et al. 2005).Populations throughout the range of this species are susceptible to typhoons and other storm events (Mickleburgh et al. 1992; Flannery 1995). In the early 1990s, storms diminished populations in Samoa and American Samoa, by destroying food sources and leading to noticeable changes is foraging behaviour and overhunting (Daschbach 1990; Craig et al. 1994; Pierson et al. 1996; Grant et al. 1997).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Nearly half of the native forests in the Valdivian Ecoregion in Chile (35º-43º30’) were lost between 1550 and 2007 (Lara et al. 2012). This area comprise most of Pudu distribution. Forest loss has been more severe in the northern part of Pudu distribution. For example, in coastal areas of the Maule region 67% of forest was lost between 1975 and 2000 (Echeverría et al. 2006). In La Araucanía, deforestation rates have reached 2.9% for the period 1999-2008, rates that are higher than in previous periods (Miranda et al. 2015). Deforestation rates are lower (but still important) from Los Rios to the south. Lara et al. (2012) reported that 66% and 74% of the forest present in 1550 was extant in Los Rios and Los Lagos, respectively in 2007. For coastal forests of Los Ríos region, net forest loss between 1985 and 2011 was 5.1% (Zamorano-Elgueta et al. 2015). According to Echeverría et al. (2012), in three areas of Los Lagos region forest loss occurred at annual rates of 1% (northern Chiloé, 1985-2007), 1% (Maullín, 1985-2007) and 0.8% (Rupanco, 1986-2006). Forest lost is often replaced by exotic tree plantations (e.g., Echeverría et al. 2006, Miranda et al. 2015, Zamorano-Elgueta et al. 2015). Pudus can use plantations if there is dense understory (e.g., Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2012, Simonetti et al. 2013). However, considering that the final destiny is exploitation, plantations should be—at best—considered poor quality habitat.Attacks by domestic dogs are a common threat. Dogs are associated to human houses (Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2012, Sepúlveda et al. 2015) and roads (Sepúlveda et al. 2015, Moreira-Arce et al. 2015). Dog attacks on Pudu occurs in multiple areas (Silva-Rodríguez et al. 2010, Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2011, 2012, Sepúlveda et al. 2014), even within national parks (Chang Reissig et al. 2013), and is a frequent reason for Pudu admission to rescue centers (Silva-Rodríguez et al. 2010). In the Valdivian Coastal Range, Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving (2012) reported that the probability of Pudu presence was higher in areas with lower probability of dog presence. Similar scenarios may occur in other areas such as Chiloé (J. Jiménez, pers. obs.). The importance of dogs as a threat is expected to be critical in fragmented landscapes, where the area free of dog influence may be small (Silva-Rodríguez and Sieving 2012).Invasive deer and wild boar (Sus scrofa) are present in part of Pudu distribution (Meier and Merino 2007), whereas cattle is widespread (e.g., Meier and Merino 2007, Silva-Rodríguez et al. 2010). Within Pudu distribution, non-native herbivores lead to habitat degradation, affecting understory (e.g., Veblen et al. 1989, 1992; Raffele et al. 2007), and forest regeneration (Zamorano-Elgueta et al. 2014). The potential ability of these invasive species to occupy and modify diverse habitats (Barrios and Ballari 2012) might affect the distribution of Pudu (Meier and Merino 2007). The presence of cattle-related pathogens has been documented in Pudu (e.g., pestivirus, Pizarro-Lucero et al. 2005; Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, (Salgado et al. 2015)), although the significance of these findings for Pudu populations in the wild is unclear. Wild boar could eventually prey on Pudu fawns, but to our knowledge this has not been documented.Roads are an additional threat that deserves attention. Animals are in occassion hit by cars (Silva-Rodríguez et al. 2010) even inside protected areas (Pastore and Ramilo pers. obs., Jiménez pers. obs.) and highways could be a barrier to movement, although this has not been tested. However, roads and road development is a concern because of the indirect effects associated. Roads facilitate the movement of dogs (Sepúlveda et al. 2015), one of the key threats for Pudus and land-cover change often occurs associated to roads (Wilson et al. 2005). In Chile, the projected bridge between Chiloé and mainland deserves attention, as it may connect Chiloé and mainland populations (that present genetic and morphological differences, see Fuentes-Hurtado et al. 2011) and may facilitate the invasion by carnivores that are native in mainland, but absent from Chiloé, such as foxes and pumas. Thus, road development cannot be seen simply as animals killed by cars, but as an important driver of other threats.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Habitat loss is particularly severe for the populations that occur in small forest islands and galleries at the northern and eastern limits of the range. Sources of deforestation in this environment include growing numbers of small holder farmers, expansion of nomadic pastoralism, small-scale logging and charcoal production. These latter threats are growing in a zone where ready sources of timber and fuel wood are scarce. Even low levels of firewood, house pole collection and timber harvest could have severe impact on populations in these areas, as they are constrained to very small home ranges and may be exposed to periods of stress exacerbated by the removal of key resources. In parts of DRC, in portions of the range originally covered by contiguous forest, there are growing halos of deforestation around the population centres of Bunia, Isiro, Buta, Lisala and Gemena. A band of forest loss and degradation up to 100 km wide now isolates P. oustaleti populations in the Abubumbazi forest block. Commercial scale oil-palm plantations established in the Lisala area have led to permanent loss of habitat. Areas showing high rates of deforestation affect about 25% of P. oustaleti’s range (Harris et al. 2017). Forest loss in the current geographic range of the taxon totaled around 15,000 km² between 2001 and 2016 (Global Forest Watch/WRI 2018). Hunting, usually with shotguns, is a threat to P. oustaleti in a number of areas, including Buta and the Rubi-Télé Hunting Domain (T. Hart, pers. comm. 2007), and across the whole of northern Congo and southwestern CAR outside the areas protected by wildlife guards. Though hunting is not yet common in the Ituri forest, it appears to be a growing threat in the Ituri landscape, in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve and the adjacent, unprotected Mai Tatu forest (R. Mwinyihali, pers. comm. 2018). Widespread hunting was recorded in the Abubumbazi Forest in the northwest extreme of the species range in DRC, where no red colobus were recorded during a brief survey (J. Hart pers. obs. 1989). The bushmeat trade is active around Buta-Aketi (Hicks et al. 2010). Two red colobus were amng 169 monkey carcasses recorded for sale during 2007 and 2008 surveys (Hicks, unpublished data). One red colobus was among 21 identified monkey carcasses encountered between Banalia-Buta-Titulé in 2012 (Hicks 2014).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

To some degree, hunting for meat and skins remains a threat (e.g., around Mbizi; Davenport et al. 2007). The taxon also appears to be heavily predated by Chimpanzees. At Ngogo in Kibale National Park, the Colobus Monkeys live with the largest community of Chimpanzees recorded anywhere, which form huge hunting parties against that result in the highest hunting success rate known for any large vertebrate predator (Struhsaker 2010). The population in Gombe Stream National Park appears to be seriously threatened with extinction because of predation by Chimpanzees and because of the very small size (ca 80 km²) and isolation of Gombe (Struhsaker 2005).    ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Recent genetic studies suggest  this population isolation is leading to moderate-to-strong genetic drift  in many portions of the range (Fenderson et al. 2011, Fenderson et al. 2014, Cheeseman 2017).New  England Cottontails have historically declined due to maturation of  second-growth forests and fragmentation of suitable habitat (Litvaitis et al.  2008). The conversion of native shrublands to other land uses,  confusion with Eastern Cottontails by sportsmen, and lack of education  on existence, biology, and habitat requirements of this species cause  problems for the conservation of this species.Competition with Eastern Cottontails may also place pressure on New England Cottontail populations (Litvaitis et al.  2008). Decline in the New England Cottontail coincides with growth in  Eastern Cottontail populations. Captive trials suggest that the species  may not be exerting much competition (Litvaitis et al. 2008),  however, telemetry estimates indicate that habitat usage for the New  England Cottontail shifts where the two species overlap in distribution  (Cheeseman 2017).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Management in the late 1900s was mostly conservative hunting quotas to foster recovery and recolonization from the historic declines. Currently, there is increasing realization that periodically on some arctic islands, die-offs of up to 40% of the island’s muskoxen occur when warmer fall weather leads to icing and deeper snow which restrict forage availability. On the North American mainland, typically muskoxen have expanded their range recolonizing historic ranges but behind the colonizing edge, abundance declines at least partially due to predation by wolves and grizzly bears. A persistent concern of people is that muskoxen through their presence (smell) and foraging are detrimental to caribou (Rangifer tarandus). The environmental consequences of climate warming is likely to have an impact on this species.In Greenland, there are no major threats, although the fact that populations are often small in size and scattered, make them vulnerable to local or regional fluctuations in climate. Most populations  are within the National Park, where they are protected from hunting. The portion of the population which is south of the National Park sustains a regulated quota harvest.

In his primate population surveys in a number of sites in the upper Amazon, south of the Rio Solimões in Brazil, Peres (1990) found that Lagothrix, Ateles and Alouatta were prime targets for hunting. Both the woolly monkeys and the spider monkeys were ""extremely rare, if not locally extinct"", he believed because of hunting, at three of the sites. They were not seen during his transect surveys at the three sites (150 km walked). At one of these sites (Riozinho), between the rios Juruá and Tefé , Peres (1990) reported that the single extended family of rubber tappers (three hunters) there killed over 200 woolly monkeys in a little less than two years, resulting in their local extinction (spider monkeys were nearly extinct there and howlers ""drastically reduced""). For these larger species, hunting is the main threat prior to deforestation, and even low-intensity colonization severely reduces their numbers. The females with offspring tend to be targeted by hunters, so that they can sell the infants as pets. Heavy deforestation also occurs in many parts of this species' range, notably in the east and south (Mato Grosso, Rondonia).

Currently, hunting pressure for pest control has been reduced only in the Cerro el Copey National Park.

However, deforestation has increased in its distribution range during the last 10 years, threatening these populations (De La Torre et al. 2011, Llactayo et al. 2013).    The status of A. vociferans populations in Ecuador is unknown. However, given the actual conditions of the habitat within its distribution (large extensions of forest converted to agriculture and silvo-pasture land), it is inferred that the species has been affected (De La Torre et al. 2011). Furthermore, in the Napo region of Peru, deforestation along river systems is high and increasing, as is deforestation from oil exploration and exploitation, together with associated immigration.  The long-term and systematic capture of large numbers of individuals for biomedical research in Colombia, and the release of individuals post-experimentation, are the main threats for A. vociferans populations in the Brazil-Colombia-Peru border. The species has not been reported in the north bank of the Amazon River in Colombia for the last seven years, where the species has been systematically taken since the early 1980’s for local malaria research (Maldonado and Peck 2014). Furthermore, Ruiz‐Garcia et al. (2013) and Maldonado and Peck (2014) suggested that the long term post-experimental releases of A. nancymaae in Colombia may have displaced wild populations of A. vociferans at release sites. However, long‐term population studies are required to precisely determine the current status of A. vociferans in the area, and to clarify the taxonomy of the genus at the Brazil-Colombia-Peru border area to allow environmental authorities to implement a management plan for local A. vociferans populations (Maldonado et al., 2009; Ruiz-García et al. 2013).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

The heavy widespread ongoing deforestation in South-east Asia in the last half-century will thus have greatly reduced the area available to the species, and in areas retaining high levels of forest conversion (e.g. Sumatra) declines are doubtless ongoing. Much forest has also been degraded and fragmented: the available evidence suggests this will have had relatively little effect (e.g., Viet Nam: Willcox et al. 2012; Singapore: Chua et al. 2012; Java: Moore and Wihermanto 2014). Although there is as yet no confirmation of large numbers in higher montane areas (over 1,500 m) there is still a sizeable altitudinal band holding the species above the zone of heaviest forest clearance, the lowlands. Hunting is another potential threat but in reality seems to have little effect on the species's populations within remaining habitat. Especially in Indochina, where general mammal hunting levels are extremely high, most active hunting is with dogs and projectiles by day, and most passive trapping (snares etc.) is at ground level. The species's nocturnal, arboreal, habits therefore insulate it from the sort of heavy pressures facing ground-dwelling and/or diurnal species (Willcox et al. 2012). Active night hunting appears to be the only effective means of hunting this civet and, because this is labour-intensive, is relatively rarely undertaken for arboreal mammals in most of this species's range (e.g. Walston and Duckworth 2003). In Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Myanmar, spotlight hunting does occur, but again the impact on this species is minimal because hunters focus on taking higher market value species (in terms of yield per unit effort) such as ungulates and frogs, and concentrate for these almost exclusively at ground level (e.g. Walston and Duckworth 2003).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

It is also threatened by conversion to oil palm plantations, and forest clearing and product extraction by local people (Whittaker 2006). Recently, hunting pressure has increased because of increased access to remote areas due to logging roads and tracks, as well as the replacement of bows and arrows with .177 caliber air rifles (Whittaker 2006). Also, local rituals and taboos which formerly regulated hunting have been replaced by Christianity (Whittaker 2006). The pet trade is also a threat to this species (Whittaker 2006). Although this may be a greater threat to this species than to other gibbons (D. Whittaker pers. comm.), it is rarely seen in the pet-trade in Java (Nijman 2005).The extent of the threats from logging, hunting, and the pet trade faced by this species varies depending on location. The very large population in Siberut National Park, on central Siberut, lives in a protected area but is subject to moderate hunting pressure from local people. In the Peleonan forest, northern Siberut, the habitat was logged 20 years prior but faces low hunting pressure. This area is significant because four of the endemic Mentawai primates (H. klossii, Simias concolor, Presbytis potenziani and Macaca siberu) exist here in high densities. Populations in Saureinu, Sipora are subject to traditional use by locals but limited logging. In South Pagai, forest plots are selectively logged but there is high hunting pressure. Animals on North Pagai were not censused, but logging and hunting occurs there as well (Whittaker 2005b).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Changing land-use and hunting pressure have caused a reduction in its former range. This pig species is not considered threatened over much of its range at the present time (Burton and Macdonald 2006). However, wide scale deforestation for timber and conversion of land for agriculture, coupled with human population expansion and immigration have resulted in a marked contraction of its range in some places. In addition, resources are insufficient to enforce controls on hunting, and there are reports that subsistence and/or organized commercial hunting is continuing even within designated reserves and national parks (Smiet 1982, Blouch 1990). The high volume of trade in this species raises concerns about the sustainability of this current harvesting rate. Completion of the Trans-Sulawesi Highway (1980) probably increased importation of wildlife within and into North Sulawesi from the rest of the island. Data was recently collected from market surveys from northeast Sulawesi and road blocks on the Trans-Sulawesi Highway (Lee et al. 2005). In the study it was noted that ""trade in the Sulawesi pig is alarmingly high for such a large-bodied animal"". The expansion of human settlements also brings an increased threat of genetic contamination and/or disease to the wild pig populations. Future threats will include the loss of this species high genetic diversity through the decline into small isolated populations (Burton and Macdonald 2006).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The species is increasing in Japan (where it is hunted and culled to reduce crop and forest depredation), and stable in Russia and probably Taiwan. The subspecies in Viet Nam (C. n. pseudaxi) and Taiwan (C. n. taiouanus) were hunted for meat and antler velvet for use in traditional medicine (Dang Huy Huynh et al. 1990, McCullough 1974). In Viet Nam, velvet from Cervus nippon is traded in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (Dang Huy Huynh, Tran Van Duc, and Hoang Minh Khien pers. comm.). All subspecies of Sika have been hunted widely in China during the past 100 years (Ohtaishi and Gao 1990) and in Korea. In Japan, Red Deer farming used to be very popular, but now animals are being released into the wild raising the risk of hybridization in the wild with Cervus nippon. Native and introduced populations are threatened by hybridization, with numerous populations of uncertain provenance or mixed ancestry (Grubb 2005). In China, in addition to continued loss of habitat, loss of genetic diversity through anthropogenic population subdivision is also a conservation concern (Lu et al. 2006).C. n. pseudaxis in Viet Nam, and C. n. mandarinus and C. n. taiouanus in China, were probably extirpated in the wild as a result of hunting and habitat conversion for agriculture (Ratajszczak 1990; Dang Huy Huynh, Tran Van Duc and Hoang Minh Khien pers. comms.; IUCN 1972). The small captive population of C. n. pseudaxis in Cuc Phuong National Park is presently threatened by poaching. In China, C. e. sichuanicus is threatened by poaching outside Tiebu Nature Reserve (Sheng Helin and Zhang Endi pers. comm. 1990), and by encroachment on their habitats (including by deer farms; Hu 1998). In Japan, C. n. keramae has been almost extirpated by hunting, and remains only on unoccupied islets where competition with feral goats and habitat change constitute serious threats (Anonymous 1990). Water pollution is a serious problem for the deer (WWF 1984).",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Indeed, they are often associated and all Borneo’s ungulates suffer from the increased hunting that often accompanies logging (Bennett and Dahaban 1995, Bennett and Gumal 2001), such that hunting to local extinction is the chief detrimental effect of logging on ungulates in Sarawak (Bennett and Gumal 2001). This conclusion probably is applicable across the Sundaic region. Southern Red Muntjac is widely hunted across its range (e.g. Bennett et al. 2000, Linkie et al. 2003, S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008, based on unpubl. data, East Java, 1991–2002), it is the most sought-after wild meat in Peninsular Malaysia (Kawanishi and Sunquist 2004) and is among the most preferred in Indonesia, although Sambar is the preferred species at least in East Kalimantan (Semiadi et al. 2004, Semiadi 2005).However, there is no strong evidence that either hunting or habitat disruption are actually threats to the survival of populations except in the case of islands such as Singapore, where it is now extinct (Baker and Lim 2008). Peak densities are not in pristine forest (see Habitat and Ecology), and in Danum Valley (Sabah, Borneo), an area with negligible hunting, M. muntjak strongly increased in densities after logging (Heydon 1994, Davies et al. 2001), a weaker increase was found by Duff et al. (1984). Hence, even quite severe habitat disruption can increase ecological carrying capacity for this muntjac, at least temporarily.In an area with heavy hunting, recorded densities of muntjacs (presumed M. muntjak) were twice as high in areas with low than with high human population density within 10 km of the Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Sumatra, but this difference was not statistically significant (O'Brien et al. 2003). Poaching pressure in Kerinci-Seblat National Park, Sumatra, among snared ungulates was greatest for muntjac as assessed by the diameter of the cable. Snaring is locally very high in the protected area, e.g. 51 snares (mostly of size suitable for muntjac) were found in 1 km² (Linkie et al. 2003), although it is much less intense than in areas of Indochina supporting the related M. vaginalis (J. Holden pers. comm. 2008). Data are too sparse to determine whether this hunting is driving declines. Habitat loss is also severe including within parts of the park (Linkie et al. 2003), and is an increasing phenomenon in Java (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008).Muntjacs are widely and heavily hunted on Borneo for meat, skins, and as a source of traditional remedies (Bennett et al. 2000, Mohd Azlan J. pers. comm. 2008, Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008, G.M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008, A.C. Sebastian pers. comm. 2008, Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008). Traditionally, hunting used traps, dogs and spears, and blowpipes. Hunters in remote parts of the interior still use these methods, but most animals now die by gunfire. Sarawak held 60,000 legally registered shotguns while Sabah held almost 13,000 in the mid 1990s (Bennett et al. 2000). Methods used in Indonesia include guns and spotlights along logging roads, snaring, and dogs (G.M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008, S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). The combination of dogs and guns may be particularly efficient (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008). Snaring is still very heavy outside well-secured areas, but shotguns remain an even bigger problem (Bennett et al. 2000, J. Mohd Azlan pers. comm. 2008, Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008). Unaccompanied packs of stray or even perhaps feral dogs are also likely to be a threat, particularly in forest isolates close to urban areas (e.g. Similajau National Park, J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). It is unlikely that hunters make any distinction between the two Bornean muntjac species directly, although it is plausible that M. muntjak is under lower hunting pressure than is M. atherodes reflecting its purported predominance in the hills and mountains (although there is little empirical evidence to support this), whereas most of the logging concessions currently lie in the lowlands. Some ethnic groups, at least the Punan, have traditional beliefs against eating muntjac meat (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008), but over most of (at least) Malaysian Borneo, “in general, everyone will hunt and eat anything” (Bennett et al. 2000). Much hunting is for the market rather than local use, so there is a limitless demand. Bennett and Gumal (2001) profiled the hunting of ungulates in Sarawak in the mid 1990s thus: muntjacs (along with Bearded Hog Sus barbatus and Sambar Rusa unicolor) are heavily shot for wild meat trade across Sarawak, and these ungulates are the species most sought by the restaurants. Wild meat is widely sold in towns, villages, restaurants and logging camps throughout Sarawak, 250 sales outlets were estimated across the state in 1996, with an annual trade worth 3.75 million USD. Along the Rejang river alone, in the mid 1980s, 250 muntjacs were sold per year (Caldecott 1988). The market for meat is great and probably expanding. There were, then, no controls on commercial hunting of non-protected species (including muntjacs). The Master Plan for Wildlife in Sarawak (Wildlife Conservation Society and Sarawak Forest Department 1996) introduced a strict ban on all wildlife trade, shotgun ownership and cartridge sales in the late 1990s (Bennett and Gumal 2001). Substantial numbers of muntjacs are, nevertheless, still killed in the state, as they are elsewhere in Borneo.Bennett et al. (2000) considered the effects of this onslaught upon muntjacs (not distinguished to species) through a lengthy hunting study in February 1993 to June 1995, in both Bornean states of Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah), each with eight study areas. Muntjacs constituted only 3–10% of animals killed, but index counts of signs show an inverse relationship between sign index and hunting pressure so strong that the latter over-rode the effects of habitat variables in determining their densities. Hunting was so ubiquitous, even in protected areas, that in the two states, only one site (part of Danum Valley, Sabah) could be found as a control, where there was primary forest but negligible hunting levels. They concluded that “the only single factor offering any effective protection for [quarry species of] wildlife is difficulty of access”, whether animals are protected or non-protected species, inside or outside protected areas, had no significant restraint on hunting levels. In the interim, much forest has been lost and muntjac populations in the smaller and more isolated areas that remain must now be more vulnerable to local extinctions.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Throughout Asia the potential threat to its continued survival is destruction of its habitats due to changing land use pattern in the form of developmental activities. In many parts of Asia, the habitats have been reduced due to reclamation of peat swamp forests and mangroves, aquaculture activities along the intertidal wetlands and loss of hill streams. In India the primary threats are loss of habitats due to tea and coffee plantations along the hills, in the coastal areas loss of mangroves due to aquaculture and increased human settlements and siltation of smaller hill streams due to deforestation. Increased influx of pesticides into the streams from the plantations reduces the quality of the habitats. The threat posed by poaching is still very significant in many parts of India, and SE Asia and will certainly count as a major threat that needs to be constantly monitored. Poaching for pelt has been reported from across the Western Ghats in south India (Prakash et al. 2012).Another important threat to Asian Small-clawed Otter is reduction in prey biomass due to over-exploitation, which make its remaining habitats unsustainable. Pollution is probably the single most important factor causing decline in the population of many fish species (Dehadrai and Ponniah 1997).

The threats to Small-clawed Otter is prominent in its western range so much so that since last 60 years its range has shrunk considerable moving west to east from Himachal Pradesh to Assam (Hussain et al. 2011).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

However, the remaining forests are being destroyed at an unprecedented rate for the region and the populations surviving are seriously depleted and fragmented. An important aspect which has contributed to the more favourable situation of the Golden-headed Lion Tamarin is the traditional and fairly widespread use of the “cabruca” system for shading cacao trees. Some of the original canopy trees are left standing, and this allows for connectivity between forest patches. If well managed, this could be an important management tool for future conservation efforts. Threats to Golden-headed Lion Tamarins come from socio-economic transformations resulting from the difficulties of the cocoa industry (low prices and disease epidemics), that have dominated the region over the last 15 years, resulting in the expansion of alternative crops, notably African palm oil and coconuts (Alger and Caldas 1994). In the west of its range, the forest is increasingly destroyed and fragmented as a result of cattle ranching (Pinto 1994; Pinto and Rylands 1997).A study by Dietz et al. (2000) examined inbreeding depression in small (50 or less) isolated populations of L. rosalia. They concluded that it reduced probability of long-term survival by about one-third. There is every reason to believe that inbreeding depression is likewise prejudicial to the isolated populations of L. chrysomelas, most especially in the western half of its range where forest fragmentation is extreme (Pinto and Rylands, 1997).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Sea Otters become hypothermic when oiled because oiled Sea Otter fur loses its insulative property and Sea Otters have no blubber layer, oil can be ingested while grooming, leading to gastrointestinal disorders, other ailments and death and volatile components of oil inhaled by Sea Otters can cause lung damage. Estimates of Sea Otter mortality following the Exxon Valdez spill in Prince William Sound ranged from 2,650 (Garrott et al. 1993) to 3,905 (DeGange et al. 1994).Significant numbers of Sea Otters drowned in gill and trammel nets in California from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s (Estes 1990). Recent population declines in California’s Sea Otters may be incidental to summer commercial fisheries. Estes et al. (2003) found that Sea Otter mortality was elevated in the summer months and that commercial fin fish landings in the coastal live trap fishery increased. Recent analyses indicated annual Sea Otter carcass recoveries and reported fishery landings were significantly correlated.Thomas and Cole (1996) found 10% of southern Sea Otters they examined to be emaciated without specific cause of mortality. Severe weather and periodic climatic events such as El Niño can disrupt foraging behaviour and food availability, and increase pup loss. Under these circumstances, sea otters may find it difficult to meet their high metabolic needs, leading to malnutrition or starvation. Serious tooth wear in older sea otters may also contribute to mortality (Riedman and Estes 1990). Recent studies have found infectious disease to be an important mortality factor in California Sea Otter populations. Around 280 Sea Otters found dead have been linked “to a pair of protozoan parasites, Toxoplasma gondii and Sacrocystis neurona, that are known to breed in cats and opossums (Conrad et al. 2005, Johnson et al. 2009). In Alaska, Streptococcal endocarditis, encephalitis and/or septicaemia, referred to as Strep. syndrome has been identified in forensic-level necropies of northern Sea Otters (Unusual Mortality Event Working Group) as well as trauma from boat strikes.  Goldstein et al. (2009) found northern Sea Otters from the Alaska Peninsula, Kodiak and Kachemak Bay area infected with phocine distemper.Killer Whales (Orcinus orca), Great White Sharks (Carcharodon carcharias), Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), Coyotes (Canis latrans), and Brown Bears (Ursus arctos) have been documented as predators of Sea Otters (Riedman and Estes 1990). Predation by Killer Whales is one factor that is believed to have caused Sea Otter population declines across the Western Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands (Doroff et al. 2003, Estes et al. 1998, Hatfield et al. 1998). Significant declines in preferred prey species populations - Northern Fur Seals (Callorhinus ursinus), Harbour Seals (Phoca vitulina), and Steller Sea Lions (Eumetopias jubatus) are believed to have caused Killer Whales to prey switch and consume Sea Otters (Estes et al. 1998).Other potential threats to Sea Otters come under the climate change umbrella and include: ocean acidification in the north Pacific, pathogen transport, marine invasive species, biotoxins sequestered  in bivalve prey, and frequency and intensity of storm events.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Habitat has been lost, degraded, and fragmented by overharvest of forest products (timber, fuelwood, fodder, fruits, honey), establishment of monoculture plantations (e.g. teak, eucalyptus), over-grazing, extraction of minerals, quarrying, settlement of refugees, and expansion of agricultural areas, human settlements, and roads (Santiapillai and Santiapillai 1990).  In some parts of the range, encounters between people and Sloth Bears have led to numerous serious human injuries and many deaths (Rajpurohit and Krausman 2000, Bargali et al. 2005, Dharaiya and Ratnayeke 2009, Ratnayeke et al. 2014). Such incidents occur where people frequently use bear habitat, and where the habitat has become severely degraded, prompting bears to seek food and water in closer proximity to humans. Most attacks occur when people and bears surprised each other in thickets or around rock outcrops, where visibility is obstructed: the bear(s)—sometimes multiple adult bears are involved—rush at, pursue, and knock down the person, and often attack the face. Bears that attack or threaten to attack people may ultimately be killed. Sloth Bear attacks outside protected areas are increasing, and hostility of local people towards bears has made bear conservation more difficult (Bargali et al. 2005, Dharaiya and Ratnayeke 2009, Mardaraj 2014). Increasing numbers of Sloth Bear attacks appear to be related to rising human populations (Ratnayeke et al. 2014).  The only natural (non-human) threats to Sloth Bears are Tigers (Panthera tigris) and possibly Leopards (P. pardus). The threat of Tiger predation may account for the aggressive nature of Sloth Bears (Joshi et al. 1999). Sloth Bears have been observed fending off Tigers, but they are also occasionally killed by Tigers (Gopal 1991).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The relatively large body size of this species, its conspicuousness and the value of its meat and skin make it a preferred target of hunters. Large-scale deforestation in the region, through logging, conversion to agricultural land and charcoal production, continues to reduce the habitat available to this species, especially in Côte d’Ivoire (McGraw 1998, McGraw and Oates 2007, Bitty et al. 2015). Between 2001 and 2017, Côte d’Ivoire is estimated to have lost 17% of its tree cover (Global Forest Watch 2019) and this loss has been exacerbated by a large increase in the human population in the southern forest zone and the spread of cocoa farming, including illegal cocoa cultivation within protected areas (Bitty et al. 2015, Higonnet et al. 2018). In Ghana, hunting for the commercial bushmeat trade has decimated populations of Roloway Monkeys; recent surveys have failed to find any surviving groups in two national parks (Bia and Nini-Suhien) and in several forest reserves where it formerly occurred (Gatti 2010, Oates 1999, Osei et al. 2015). Even though relatively large areas of suitable habitat remain in these theoretically protected areas, laws against hunting in these areas have been poorly enforced.

Conservation measures have brought about limited recovery in the wild and in captive conservation herds. Private commercial production of bison has resulted in significant numerical recovery, but does not provide for conservation of the bison as wildlife in the sense used for Red List designation. Existing threats include: habitat loss; genetic manipulation of commercial bison for market traits; small population effects in most conservation herds; few herds are exposed to a full range of natural limiting factors (natural selection); cattle gene introgression; loss of genetic non-exchangeability through hybridization between bison subspecies; and the threat of depopulation as a management response to infection of some wild populations hosting reportable cattle diseases. Canada, the United States and Mexico list bison nationally as both wildlife and domestic livestock. Legal status varies among State and Provincial jurisdictions. In Canada, four provinces and two territories classify bison as both wildlife and livestock. Bison are legally classified as livestock in the United Sates only 10 states classify bison as wildlife in all or portions of the state.

In Brazil and Argentina, hydroelectric projects have eliminated floodplain habitat along many large rivers, including the Tiete, Paraná, and Rio Grande (DSG 1991), and cattle ranching has severely reduced and fragmented habitats. Competition with domestic livestock may be a major threat (Schaller and Vasconcelos 1978) and pollution of waterways associated with gold mining is a serious threat in the Pantanal. Accidental introduction of bovine diseases may account for large losses reported in Bolivia during the 1970s when reproductive failure was reportedly common (Mann and Schuerholz 1977). Beccaceci (1994) also mentioned disease, hunting, and competition with livestock as possible limiting factors in the Ibera Natural Reserve, Argentina. In the Paraná River Delta, the conversion of marshes for exotic tree plantation and hunting threaten the population in Argentina (Varela 2003).

Although the species is locally common in the foothills of mountains on the east edge of the coastal plain in Humboldt County, loss and fragmentation of habitat has been extensive everywhere within the range (Williams 1986). Timber harvest and clearing of trees for agriculture and home sites have significantly reduced available habitat and fragmented populations (Maser et al. 1981). Construction of roads and power lines has also contributed to the loss of habitat and fragmentation and isolation of populations. Furthermore, these trends are likely to continue at an accelerated pace in the future (Williams 1986).Previously it was believed that this vole requires old-growth mesic forest and, according to Gould (1987), projections were that all old-growth forests capable of sustaining a commercial harvest in California would be cut within 25 years. Obviously such a situation would be a grave threat to the tree vole. However, recent surveys have found many nests in secondary forest and on drier inland slopes. The vast majority of recent observations come from secondary growth forest, some of which is 70-80 years old and fairly well developed (Gordon Gould pers. comm., 1998). A 1984-1985 study conducted nest surveys in nine 20-hectare sites of young, mature, and old-growth Douglas-fir forests in northern California. A total of 79 nests were found with 39 nests occurring in old-growth forest, 22 nests in mature forest, and 18 nests in young forest (Meiselman 1987). Thus this species appears to be more adaptable and probably better able to disperse through various habitats than was previously believed.This vole may have limited dispersal capabilities and thus may be vulnerable to habitat loss or fragmentation (Huff et al. 1992, cited by Adam and Hayes (1998).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The species is also threatened by habitat loss, especially from logging. Since 1999, when a ban stopped most commercial logging in the region, habitat loss has slowed, but it is still a large potential threat in the future. Clearing of forest land for summer grazing pasture had decreased suitable habitat for the monkeys by 31% between 1958 and 1997 (Xiao et al. 2003).

Current offtake levels are unsustainable – even legally-protected areas suffer high levels of poaching. The remaining population of Cross River Gorillas is small and fragmented, which puts each subpopulation at particular risk from poaching. While Gorillas do not generally appear to be targeted by hunters, it is estimated that opportunistic hunting removes at least 1–3 Cross River Gorillas from the population each year. Additionally, snares targeting other species may trap Gorillas, causing injury or death. Until the mid-1990s, much of the Western Lowland Gorilla’s range included vast, roadless blocks of forest that were extremely difficult to access, where human population densities were very low and Gorilla densities high. In the last quarter century, however, almost all unprotected terra firma forest in this region has been allocated as logging concessions (Global Forest Watch 2016). This means that much of the once-remote, inaccessible forest is now covered by a network of logging roads (Laporte et al. 2007), which gives easy access to both hunters entering the forest and traffickers taking consignments of bushmeat (and ivory) out of the forest to distant destinations – often towns and cities where meat fetches high prices. Throughout Central Africa, mining permits for prospecting or resource extraction are being issued over an increasingly large surface area. As well as direct removal of Gorilla habitat, depending on the type of extraction, mining leads to very high rates of human immigration and the creation of yet more access roads, which are used for poaching (e.g., Edwards et al. 2014). The region’s governance is typically poor (Transparency International 2016); the weak law enforcement and corruption that enable poaching are evident in ivory trafficking (Bennett 2014), but also widespread elsewhere (Bour et al. 2013). In addition, huge road projects that will substantially fragment Gorilla habitat are currently underway (Laurance et al. 2015). The ease and speed of transport is now orders of magnitude higher than before the creation of such access roads, and hunting pressures are much higher. Across their range, Gorilla densities are lowest near roads, except where forest guards operate control points or roadblocks (Strindberg et al. 2018). In addition, human populations in these once remote areas have grown, as people migrate to the employment opportunities offered by logging companies (Wilkie et al. 2000, Poulsen et al. 2009).Disease - The second major driver of Western Lowland Gorilla decline is infectious disease, specifically Ebola virus disease (EVD). Surveys carried out from the 1980s to the present day show that there were a series of massive great ape die-offs in a large, mostly-intact forested area straddling the border between northeastern Gabon and northwestern Congo, which includes several national parks and logging concessions (Walsh et al. 2003; Maisels et al. 2004, 2013). Walsh et al. (2008) estimated that three quarters of Western Lowland Gorillas in six protected areas affected by Ebolavirus were lost between 1995 and 2000. Typical mortality rate during the worst disease outbreaks was 95% (Bermejo et al. 2006, Caillaud et al. 2006). In protected areas, populations hit by disease began to recover within a decade (e.g., Genton et al. 2012); however, total recovery would take 75–131 years in the absence of poaching, which is an unlikely scenario (Ryan and Walsh 2011). Ebola virus has already been detected to the east of the Mambili River, a major river barrier between Odzala-Kokoua National Park and the Sangha River (Reed et al. 2014). Although rivers and forest fragmentation seem to present a partial barrier to the spread of Ebola, large numbers of Gorillas could be wiped out in a short space of time, as transmission between individuals is rapid and large areas can be affected by a single outbreak (Walsh et al. 2007, 2009). The small size of the Cross River population means it is also highly vulnerable to infectious disease. Ebolavirus has not been reported in the Cross River Gorillas, but their close proximity to dense human populations and livestock heightens the risks of disease transmission (Dunn et al. 2014).Habitat degradation and destruction - Habitat loss is emerging as a major threat to Western Gorillas. As oil-palm plantations in Asia reach capacity, Africa is becoming the new frontier for this crop, offering excellent economic prospects in countries with appropriate rainfall, soil and temperatures (Rival and Lavang 2014). Unfortunately, such areas coincide with good Gorilla habitat: 73.8% of the Western Lowland Gorilla’s range is considered suitable for oil palm (Wich et al. 2014). The recent expansion of industrial-scale mineral extraction and the creation of open-pit mines are of great concern (Edwards et al. 2014, Lanjouw 2014), and also lead to the establishment of development corridors, which can be several kilometres wide and add to areas of “lost forest” (Laurance et al. 2015). There is a disconnect between the various bodies responsible for land-use planning in the realms of conservation, mining and agriculture in all Western Gorilla range states except Gabon. Consequently, there is increasing competition for land between long-term conservation needs and immediate financial gain as governments explore the potential of clearing natural habitat in favour of economic development. Without careful and immediate land-use planning that involves cooperation between the government bodies responsible for protected areas and wildlife on one hand, and economic and agricultural development on the other, large areas of Western Lowland Gorilla habitat could be cleared within a few decades. The lack of effective protected area management throughout much of the Cross River Gorilla’s range combined with the lack of protected status for much of the Gorillas’ habitat in Cameroon, threatens the future availability of habitat suitable for the population. Conversion of forest for agriculture and grazing is occurring rapidly in many parts of the Gorillas’ range and the largest protected areas in which Cross River Gorillas occur contain enclaves of human settlements whose farmlands have spread beyond their legal boundaries. Expansion of these settlements and associated development of access routes in the form of roads and bridges inside the protected areas exacerbate subdivision of the Cross River Gorilla population. In both Cameroon and Nigeria, the construction and improvement of roads outside protected areas also threatens to increase subdivision of Gorilla populations through habitat disturbance and intensification of forest resource extraction. Increasing access will also exacerbate poaching pressure. While most habitat loss in the region is the result of small-scale agriculture, commercial logging and industrial agriculture (e.g., for oil palm) are also impending threats.Climate change - Climate change will affect both subspecies of Western Gorilla, as it is already thought to be affecting the Central African tropical moist forests (Lewis et al. 2013). Although the likely impacts of global climate change are not yet known, some predictions suggest a drying of this region with potentially negative consequences for forest ecology, such as changes in fruit and flower phenology, forest productivity and increased vulnerability to fire, and even forest retreat (James et al. 2013). Seasonal changes in precipitation and temperature, and weather extremes are likely ongoing and set to continue (Lovett 2015). Negative impacts on great apes have already been predicted (Lehmann et al. 2010), particularly along the coast (Korstjens et al. 2010). Climate change is the least likely factor for which effective action for great apes and for African tropical forests in general can be taken in a timely manner. Climate talks in 2015 resulted in international cooperative agreement between most of the world’s nations regarding the need for action; however, the task of reversing, or even flattening current temperature trends will be extremely challenging.For more details, see the two Gorilla gorilla subspecies assessments.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

As the species becomes rare or absent from eastern sections of the northern peninsula, hunting is moving to the west and centre. For example, Babirusa from the area to the north of Palu and from Lore Lindu National Park (although the species now appears severely depleted in the latter) are being hunted and sold to traders from North Sulawesi (Burton 2002). The species is also increasingly threatened by commercial logging, and by the spread of other land-uses resulting in forest conversion and degradation (MacDonald 1993, Riley 2002). Total lowland forest loss on the island is estimated to be likely more than 75% (Riley 2002). An additional threat is present in the form of prospective iron ore mining, particularly in the northwestern part of the northern peninsula. The natural dry zone in the northwest of central Sulawesi is probably prone to further drying as a result of climate change. Details are sparse, but reduction in tree cover and fruiting would result.   In southeast Sulawesi there has been an expansion of cultivated areas for commercial tree-fruit crops. Babirusa in the forest are being caught in traps set for anoa; they are killed and left to rot in the forest as the local muslim hunters view them as vermin contaminating their traps (Macdonald 2016). In the more coastal areas, some Babirusas are being deliberately trapped to supply teeth to the Bali mask-making trade (Macdonald 2016). Villages of Balinese people around the coast are also stimulating the ‘pig-meat’ trade.

These threats are compounded by the species' restricted range (Schoppe et al. in prep a). The Philippine Pangolin was historically hunted at a local level for meat and traditional uses, and for trade at a domestic level (i.e. within the Philippines) which included its blood, meat, skins, and scales (Esselstyn et al. 2004, Cruz et al. 2007, Schoppe and Cruz 2009). International trade (whole animal, meat, scales and skin) was rare in 2008 (Schoppe and Cruz 2009) and appeared to have declined following heavy exploitation of the species during the 1970s-1990s for international trade in skins. During the 1970s-1990s, the species had not been recognised as distinct from the Sunda Pangolin, and was traded under CITES as the Sunda Pangolin (see Challender et al. 2015). Heaney et al. (1998) stated that the species was heavily hunted, and probably threatened, whilst Esselstyn et al. (2004) reported that hunting pressure was moderate. Hunters stated that pangolins used to be very common in Palawan; and they reported catching greater numbers in the past, and that hunting for trade and subsistence seem to be the main reasons for its decline (Schoppe and Cruz 2009). Poaching is reported to be particularly high in northern Palawan, where it is suspected there is a higher density of the species (Bayron 2014). At the local level, hunting has been reported to be common in southern Palawan (van den Beukel et al. 2008, KFI 2008). A 2009 study indicated that the majority of pangolin hunting was for subsistence purposes (Schoppe and Cruz 2009). However, a later study indicated that the majority of pangolin hunting was for trade, i.e. no longer for local use (Bayron, 2014). This shift from subsistence to market economies has been noted among members of the Tagbanua and other ethnic groups, and is a significant threat to the species (Esselstyn et al. 2004, Lacerna and Widmann 2008). Hunting for national trade (i.e. with the Philippines) has been known to occur since the 1980s (Schoppe and Cruz 2009). The Philippine Pangolin is poached for the food and traditional medicine markets within Palawan and in major cities in the Philippines including Manila (Schoppe and Alvarado 2015, TRAFFIC 2018). Recent evidence also demonstrates there is an increasing illicit international trade involving the species, the full extent of which is unknown (Cruz et al. 2007, Schoppe and Cruz 2009, Pantel and Anak 2010, Challender et al. 2015, Challender and Waterman 2017). Despite national legislation, Asian pangolins are persistently hunted for the illegal international trade, largely to supply demand in China and Vietnam for meat and scales used in traditional medicines (Challender and Waterman 2017, Heinrich et al. 2017). As pangolin populations have been severely depleted in China (Zhang 2009), the bulk of demand for pangolin products is now met with pangolins from elsewhere in Asia, placing a more intensive hunting pressure on all Asian pangolin species, as well as the African species (Challender and Waterman 2017, Heinrich et al. 2017). The numbers of pangolins involved in national and international trafficking are unknown (Schoppe and Cruz 2009). A study analysing seizure data between 2001-2017 found a total of 39 seizure incidents within this period, involving an estimate 667 individuals, and implicating the Philippines as either a source country or place of seizure (Gomez and Sy 2018). This study found that seizures in the Philippines increased after 2010, peaking in 2012 and 2014, whilst the volume of pangolins seized increased from 2010 onwards (Gomez and Sy 2018); 52% of these seizures consisted of meat and scales, 27% dead whole individuals, 16% individuals (dead or alive), and 5% live animals (Gomez and Sy 2018). Actual volume of trade are likely higher; Challender et al. (2019) reported that trade in Asian pangolins involved more than an estimated 300,000 Asian pangolins between 2001 and 2018. According to poachers in the south of Palawan, the demand for pangolins has increased, presumably due to increasing demand from China (KFI 2008). Between 2006-2013 an increase in price and a shift from meat/live animals to scales was noticeable from 2006-2013 (S. Schoppe, unpubl. data). The observed increase in the number of confiscations and number of confiscated animals indicates either an increase in demand and/or trade or improved law enforcement (KFI 2013).  ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Indeed, north-eastern North Carolina was determined to be ideal for Red Wolf reintroductions because of a purported absence of Coyotes (Parker 1986). However, during the 1990s, the Coyote population apparently became well established in the area (P. Sumner pers. comm.; USFWS, unpubl.). From the start of the reintroduction project in 1987 through to about 2005, the Red Wolf population grew to more than 150 animals. Intensive management was useful at minimizing the extent of hybridization with Coyotes and Coyote/Red Wolf hybrids (Gese and Terletzky 2015, Gese et al. 2015). However, by about 2012, the reintroduction project had become notably characterized by significant conflict with landowners (primarily over Coyote management and general frustration with the USFWS’s implementation of the Red Wolf recovery programme) which led to a substantial increase in the illegal killing of Red Wolves.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

It is also threatened due to tourism related developmental activities (Molur et al. 2002), and from overhunting at daytime roosts, as the bones are crushed and used as asthma medicine (L. Lumsden pers. comm.). These bats are kept as pets on Car Nicobar, Kamorta, Katchal, Pulo Milo and Trinket Islands. The December 2004 tsunami is likely to have damaged the mangrove habitat of this species, however, further research is needed to confirm that the species has declined because of this event. The population on the Indonesian island of Enggano may have been wiped out by a hurricane, although this needs to be confirmed, and while threats to the species on Nias are not known, they presumably include general habitat loss. It is preyed on by feral cats on Christmas Island, and there has also been some hunting, including large numbers (up to 200), in the past, however, there is no recent evidence of hunting in this part of the species range (D. J. James pers. comm.). Corbett et al. (2003) hypothesised that a severe cyclone in 1988 initiated the decline in the Christmas Island population. However, other anecdotal evidence indicates that the decline began in the mid 1990s (Orchard 2006). The Yellow Crazy Ant Anoplolepis gracilipes has caused general ecological breakdown on Christmas Island since the late 1990s (O'Dowd et al. 2003). Disease (speculative) may be a factor. Threats to the Christmas Island population have proven difficult to identify, and are likely to be a combination of factors (Orchard 2006). James et al. (2007), provide a detailed account of possible threats to the species including, predation or disturbance by both, or either, introduced and native species; predation and/or persecution by humans (mostly formerly); loss of habitat; storm events; accidental poisoning; light pollution; and disease and parasites.

There is little direct evidence to determine the exact factors, but these probably include introduced predators (foxes in southern parts of the range and possibly cats), and competitors, the pastoral industry (particularly sheep in the Pilbara and cattle in the central southern Kimberley and Queensland) and changes in fire regimes (central Australia). In central Queensland, intensive land use coupled with the effects of the long drought conditions has led to a decrease in the number of shelter sites (tussock grasses reduced in structure) and thereby increasing the probability of predation by dingoes (Maxwell et al. 1996). Here, too, the species seems to be stable where stocking rates are conservative: property sizes in the area are large enough to have flexible stocking rates and allow for paddock spelling. Fire is also used as a management tool – summer mosaic burns of which the stock and wallabies take advantage. Properties in the area have been managed in a constant manner for the last 60 years (Maxwell et al. 1996). In the Northern Territory, Spectacled Hare-wallaby populations seem secure in the belt of Lancewood/Bullwaddy woodland extending between 16o and 18o S. However, clearing of woodland for grazing, uncontrolled burning and logging of Acacia shirleyi forests are considered threatening processes for the species in this region (Langford and Pavey 2002).L. c. conspicillatus on Barrow Island has a limited range and is potentially threatened by the introduction of predators (e.g., feral cats).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

These threats commonly interact.a). Habitat destruction and decline in quality:There are no data on threats to specific roost sites, although there has been a progressive net loss of larger native trees within protected forests (Florens et al. 2017b). Losses include the commonly used roost tree Labourdonnaisia glauca. Decline of large trees is probably even faster in the more invaded forest (which consist of about two thirds of the remaining ‘native’ forests). Threats to bats at roost sites in Mauritius (e.g., hunting, cyclones, human disturbance) can impact many roosts at one time and in no pattern. In the case of an intense cyclone, a very large number of roosts can be damaged at the same time, and the roosts damaged will depend on details of the movement of the cyclone and its strength.Forest habitats suitable for roosting and important for feeding, particularly at certain times of year, have seen major decline of what is already a habitat much depleted in both area and quality. Native forests are highly fragmented (Safford 1997, Florens 2013) and dominated by invasive alien plants, particularly in the wet forests (Florens 2008, Florens et al. 2016). The total extent of forest cover in Mauritius is c. 25% of total land area, but much of this is planted forests and shrubland (14%). Only about 5% is native forest (Hammond et al. 2015), of which only one third (1.7%) is has more than 50% native canopy cover. The remaining native forest (3.3%) has less than 50% native canopy cover (Safford 1997, Ministry of Agro-Industry and Food Security 2015). In 2013, the extent of native forest with > 50% plant canopy cover, so of “reasonable quality”, was estimated at around 2,600 ha (Ministry of Agro-Industry and Food Security 2015). While the significant holdings by government have shown little decline in recent years, natural habitat on private holdings has declined, and that decline is likely to continue. Illegal habitat destruction has also been recorded in Mauritius, even in protected areas, including some prime foraging habitats like the Cabinet Nature Reserve (Florens 2013). Declining habitat quality in the remaining protected areas is also of great concern. Density of large trees (>10 cm diameter) has roughly halved in about 70 years even in lesser invaded and protected native forests (Florens et al. 2017b). This equates to a rate of loss of about 5% large tree density per generation of P. niger, with likely consequences for the island’s P. niger carrying capacity. Although potential foraging area for bats has increased following the wider introduction of fruit farms, especially for litchi and mango, these are only available for a short period of the year (October-December). Most of the year, the bats would not survive without forest foraging. Moreover, foraging on fruit crops has brought the species into conflict with people and precipitated persecution by individuals and government-implemented mass culls.b). Invasive plant and animal species:Invasion of native forests by alien plants is of conservation relevance to Pteropus niger subpopulations on Mauritius as it reduces production of flowers and fruits among natives (Monty et al. 2013), including those that produce fruits taken by P. niger (Nyhagen et al. 2005, Baider and Florens 2006, Krivek 2017). Introduced Crab-eating Macaques (Macaca fascicularis) further reduce the abundance of native fruits available to P. niger, taking fruits of key species before they ripen enough for bat consumption (Nyhagen 2004). For example, Baider and Florens (2006) reported losses > 95% of all the fruits of Sideroxylon grandiflorum (Sapotaceae), an endemic canopy tree reliant upon P. niger for seed dispersal. They observed similar levels of damage to unripe fruit for several ebony species, e.g., the common Black Ebony (Diospyros tessellaria) and the rarer D. nodose, and for Mimusops maxima (Sapotaceae), another important canopy tree of wet forests. These trees are important native fruit trees for P. niger, that tends to eat mostly ripe fruit (Krivek 2017). The population of macaques was reduced to an estimated 8,000 animals between 2006-2007, as wild animals were trapped for export for medical research (Sussman et al. 2011). However, macaque numbers have increased over the last decade, with censuses suggesting a wild population of 30,000–40,000 (Trask et al. 2013), and more recent estimates of 50,000.The immediate and cumulative effects of invasive plants and monkeys combined limit the abundance of native fruits available to bats in the forest remnants. Moreover, only 500 ha or so of Mauritian native vegetation has been freed from alien plants out of the 90-km square or so (i.e., less than 4% of native vegetation is recovering from alien plant invasion – but not of monkey impacts). The vast majority of the native vegetation (96%) continues to degrade under the impact of invasive plants (Florens et al. 2017b).c). Cyclones:Cyclones cause direct mortality to island fruit bats, destroy roost trees, and reduce fruit and flower resources resulting in starvation and/or compromised reproduction (McConkey et al. 2004). Dramatic population declines/extirpation following cyclones have been observed in island Pteropus populations in Tonga (McConkey et al. 2004), Samoa (Craig and Syron 1992, Craig et al. 1994), Christmas Island (Richards and Hall 2012), and neighboring Rodrigues. Cheke and Dahl (1981) report previous declines of P. niger on Mauritius following cyclones Carol (1960) and Claudette (1979), based on accounts from hunters and a report by Jones (1980). Mauritius has been hit by at least 38 cyclones (winds > 120 km/hr) in the last 86 years (one cyclone every 2.26 years). This gives a mean of 8-9 such cyclones during three generations (taken as 20 years) among which an average of at least two have devastating winds exceeding 210 km/hr.  In the previous 20 years (three generations), the Mauritius Meteorological Services reported 11 cyclones/severe tropical storms, of which four were classified as intense (sustained winds > 159 km/hr) or very intense (> 210 km/hr). Although the last very intense tropical cyclone was in 2002, the risk remains high and recent trends and climate change forecasts suggest that frequency of strong cyclones is on the increase (Webster et al. 2005, Kuleshov et al. 2010, Kuleshov 2014). Maximum wind speeds are also likely to increase (Elsner et al. 2008, Deo and Ganer 2014) as is the rate at which cyclones intensify (Kishtawal et al. 2012). Climate change simulations for Mauritius further suggest a decrease in rainfall (Howells et al. 2013), which would likely negatively affect the availability of fruit and flower resources and lower the island’s carrying capacity.d). Persecution in response to conflict over fruit crops:Foraging on soft fruits has brought P. niger into conflict with fruit growers, both “backyard” and commercial, particularly during the litchi season in November-early January. Pressure from fruit growers resulted in a mass cull of the species by the Government from November-December 2015. The cull was carried out by Special Mobile Force using rifles of 0.22 calibre, and 26,225 cartridges 12 bore were used. Although the original target figure was 20% of the population (Anon. 2015), the total reported by the Commission of Police, as communicated by Honourable M. Seeruttun, the Minister of Agro-Industry and Food Security in Parliamentary Debate of 24 May 2016 (Anon. 2016) was 30,938. Per the Minister’s response, “the culling of bats was carried out in various regions throughout the island where bats exist, and these regions are mainly forest areas on both State and private lands. The island was split into four regions: the northern, southern, western and central eastern regions, and the culling exercise was carried out on different sites in those regions”.  The December 2016 cull killed 7,380 bats (Anon. 2017). During the 2015 cull, although bats were still protected from private action, illegal take of bats for sport or control increased from an estimated 2,000 bats per year (Hutson and Racey 2013) to about 5,000 individuals (www.mauritian-wildlife.org), and possibly as many as 6,000 (V. Tatayah, pers. comm). Collectively, losses since October 2015 – January 2017 are c. 50% ((38,318 bats culled + 10,000 illegal take + 2,000 powerline fatalities)/2015 pre-cull population of 99,438) (Vincenot et al. 2017).Although P. niger was protected under law by the Wildlife and National Park Act of 1993, in the 20+ years of legal protection, no fines were levied on those taking bats illegally (Florens 2013).  The Wildlife and National Park Act of 1993 was repealed by the Native Terrestrial Biodiversity and National Parks Act (2015). Although the species is still protected from hunting, Clause 36 allows establishment of a Special Technical Committee specifically for “the purpose of controlling wildlife” that has attained “pest status”, and it was under this Clause that the culls of 2015 and 2016 were enacted. This erosion of protection for P. niger increases the ease and hence probability that the government will continue to implement future culls. Assessment of the species will be implemented should other culls take place.The Sugar Protocol, which gave African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP) countries preferential access to the EU market, expired in 2009. Consequently, there has been some conversion of land from sugar cane production to other uses, including fruit crops (Ministry of Agro-Industry and Food Security 2015).  This suggests that fruit grower-bat conflicts are likely to persist (and possibly increase) over the next three generations, unless mitigation measures are adopted (netting of trees, planting dwarf varieties, pruning). Given the weakened legal protection, and continuing conflict with fruit-growers, future government-implemented culls are considered probable, and illegal killing of bats by the public likely to remain at current levels (at least 5,000 per year) without explicit intervention.e). Hunting:Hutson and Racey (2013) estimated that illegal take of bats for sport or control was c. 2,000 bats per year. Since the 2015 cull, although bats were still protected from private action, illegal take of bats for sport or control increased to an estimated 5,000 individuals (www.mauritian-wildlife.org), and possibly as many as 6,000. This offtake by hunters contributes to a sizeable annual mortality rate that will influence the long-term viability of the population. Therefore, it is important to devise methods to estimate the figure with greater accuracy and to reduce the number through enforcement and management of public perceptions.f). Accidental deaths:It is estimated that approximately 1,000-2,000 bats land and die on power lines each year (www.mauritian-wildlife.org, V. Tatayah, pers. obs.). In addition, several hundred to a thousand bats die each year in poorly-set nets used to exclude bats from fruit crops. Bats become entangled in slack nets and die of dehydration, starvation or are actively persecuted and killed by people. ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Nevertheless, road opening for wood exploitation could adversely affect the sustainable use of the forest with hunters using these roads for their illegal activities. Deforestation has dramatically increased in Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and will probably be an even bigger problem in future. As a result of the high human density, lakes and rivers are subjected to pollutants from human activities such as washing, agricultural run-off and soil erosion.Overfishing has become a critical threat to otter populations as fish community structure has been decimated across the central Congo Basin. Fishes contribute from 23 to 50 per cent of the animal protein trade in Central Africa (http://www.fao.org/docrep/t6800e/t6800e03.htm) and studies of morphometric measurements have documented the evidence of widespread overfishing for human consumption.In addition to escalation of hunting for bushmeat and skins, habitat loss and degradation, and overfishing, otter populations in Central Africa are also susceptible to pressure from the development of hydro-electric power projects, under-representation of otter habitat in Protected Areas, fishermen using nylon fishing nets, a growing prevalence of arms and munitions, as well as a dramatic decline in other species (such as the Common Hippopotamus) that contribute to the aquatic-ecosystem functioning and which support otter food supplies. Some of these threats are major, but more important is the dramatic combined effect of threats on the otters.The Congo Clawless Otter seems to average one pup in a litter and may abandon any area of occupancy with high human activity.  In one study on the Dji Dji River in Gabon (Davenport et al. 2011), reproductive Congo Clawless Otters disappeared from a site previously observed to harbour high densities of the species (alongside Hydrictis maculicollis which did decline to the same degree). Low rainfall in the previous wet season was thought to be the reason, but nothing is known about the adaptability of otters, their seasonal movements or the whereabouts of Congo Clawless Otters in response to drought conditions. As global climate change is predicted to increase the frequency and severity of droughts, these conditions may impact survival and reproduction of the species in the future.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

Hurley and Lokasola (2007) and Kuroda (cited in Butynski 2013) state that the species is under pressure from poaching in Wamba and Kokolopori, and Kuroda reports declines in populations since the 1980s (Butynski 2013). In 2014, Sakamaki et al. (2016) confirmed that C. dryas occurs in the Wamba research area, however, it was not encountered during a recent primate census at the site. The Lukuru Foundation has been surveying bushmeat in the area since 2009, and the species was never reported until 2014, when one dryas kill was seen in Bafundo. Since 2014, two additional hunter-killed Dryas Monkeys have been recorded in Bafundo. However, it may be difficult to assess accurate hunting levels for such a small primate that may be eaten locally, and not traded in regional markets.

Shanee et al. (2015), conducting field surveys from 2009 to 2013 and using combined GIS and ecological niche modelling, estimated the species’ original extent of suitable habitat at close to 33,000 km², the third lowest of the 11 Aotus species. Of this, approximately 17,700 km² of suitable habitat remained at the completion of those surveys, representing a loss of close to 50% (up to 2013). Habitat loss within three of the four provinces in which A. miconax is found—Amazonas, Huanuco and San Martin—has been disproportionately high, accounting for nearly 40% of Peru’s total deforestation during the period 2010-2014, this within only 14% of the national land surface (Ministerio del Ambiente – Peru 2015). Forest loss and fragmentation continue, especially within the peripheral areas of this species’ range, with an expansion of mining and large-scale monocultures reaching higher into the Andean foothills.

The species requires multiple, dispersed populations of food trees (Duncan et al. 1999). The winter and early spring range of this species is limited to a narrow-coastal strip in Queensland and New South Wales that is targeted for residential development, and this is the primary threat (Duncan et al. 1999; Eby and Lunney 2002). It is a pest of commercial fruit trees in parts of its range and animals are directly killed under license in orchards in New South Wales and Queensland; there is also likely to be unlicensed killing (Duncan et al. 1999; Tidemann et al. 2008; D.

The species is believed to be threatened by competition and hybridisation with Pteropus alecto, which has expanded southward at the same time as the range of P. poliocephalus has been reduced in the north (Duncan et al. 1999; G. Richards pers. comm.). The rapid rate of expansion range extension by P. alecto (by 500 km from 1990 to 2006) is of particular concern (P. Eby pers. comm.).

Reproductively valuable males were often the most common victims due to their behaviour (Stenke and Chu Xuan Canh 2004). Habitat disturbance and fragmentation resulting from the growing human population on Cat Ba Island (due in part to the country's designation of the island as a new tourism centre for northern Viet Nam), and rampant fires due to honey collectors (Nadler and Long 2000) are also threats. Tourism in the inadequately managed Cat Ba National Park has direct effects on langur natural history, such as the disturbance to habitat and perhaps behaviour caused by things like nightly spotlighting trips in speed boats around the karst archipelago where these monkeys live. The small size and fragmented nature of the remaining Cat Ba langur population means that the subspecies is at risk of inbreeding effects (or intrinsic effects to avoid inbreeding by not breeding at all), extremely limited mate-choice due to the small number of males per group, and the chance of a natural or human disaster causing total or effective extinction.In China, clearing of land with fire, burning of agricultural residue and burning charcoal often leads to uncontrolled fires that escape into adjacent karst landscapes. The white-headed Langur is surrounded in some areas by subsistence agriculture, such that much of the habitat is fragmented (Li and Rogers 2005). Tree cutting for firewood has caused further degradation to the remaining habitat (Li and Rogers 2005). Along with habitat destruction, poaching has been the primary cause of the most recent decline in the population (Wang and Tong 2004). There is some evidence that breeding is hindered in degraded habitats.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

A catastrophic decline on Santa Catalina Island was due to canine distemper virus, probably introduced by a raccoon (Procyon lotor) that “stowed-away” on a boat from the mainland (Garcelon et al. 1992, Roemer 1999, Timm et al. 2000, Coonan et al. 2010a). Efforts to control fox predation on San Clemente Island Shrikes, Lanius ludovicianus anthonyi), were previously considered a possible threat to the foxes (Roemer and Wayne 2003) but have been discontinued.Island Foxes have naturally low population levels (less than 1,500 on the larger islands and less than 500 on San Miguel) (Coonan et al. 2010a). Furthermore, they have extremely low levels of genetic variability (Gilbert et al. 1990, Wayne et al. 1991, Goldstein et al. 1999, Aguilar et al. 2004), and thus reduced ability to adapt to future environmental change. The possible introduction of new diseases from the mainland remains a threat to populations on all islands. Thus, these foxes will always be a “conservation reliant” species, requiring careful monitoring and rapid management interventions to survive (Scott et al. 2010).",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Habitat destruction for agricultural purposes and infrastructure development are also issues in Turkey and Iran (Ogurlu et al. 2010, Sanei et al. 2016). In Turkey, wetlands are mainly threatened by dam constructions and irrigation projects (Avgan 2009, Gerngross 2014). Additionally, environmental pollution and illegal hunting are threatening the Jungle Cat in Turkey too (Ogurlu et al. 2010). Also in Iran, illegal killing of Jungle Cats by shooting or trapping is a threat (Sanei et al. 2016). Jungle cats can do well in cultivated landscapes (especially those that lead to increased numbers of rodents) and artificial wetlands. However, reclamation and destruction of natural wetlands, ongoing throughout its range but particularly in the arid areas, still pose a threat to the species, as density in natural wetlands is generally higher (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Nevertheless, the species' response to urbanisation and degradation of low intensity agricultural landscapes is unclear and merits further research.Unselective trapping, snaring and poisoning around agricultural and settled areas have caused population declines in many areas throughout its range (Abu-Baker et al. 2003, Duckworth et al. 2005).  India formerly exported large numbers of Jungle Cat skins before the species came under legal protection (over 300,000 were declared as being held by traders there when export was banned in 1979), and some illegal trade (and killing) continues there (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Choudhury 2010), elsewhere in South Asia (Chowdhury et al. 2015, H.S. Baral in litt. 2014) as well as in Egypt (Glas 2013) and Afghanistan (Habibi 2004). The scarcity of Jungle Cat in mainland Southeast Asia is likely the result of high levels of hunting in open and accessible deciduous dipterocarp forest (Duckworth et al. 2005).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Based on climate change projections for West Africa this species is predicted to be highly likely to lose climate suitability (Baker and Willis 2014), its restricted range is also under serious threat of complete loss due to climate change and forest degradation (Peterson and Martínez-Meyer 2007). The growing human population has resulted in an estimated loss of 10 million hectares of forest in West Africa in the 20th century and 80% of remaining forest is agriculture-forest mosaic with a significant loss of species (Norris et al. 2010). Small mammals represent the majority of bush meat intake in Benin; they are an important food resource and are used for medicinal purposes. They are also considered pests to domesticated poultry and crops (Djagoun et al. 2008). How these threats impact this species in particular is not known. The species has been identified at a medicinal market in Benin (Djagoun et al. 2013).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

That there are roughly one million square kilometres of unoccupied Tiger habitat is a clear indication that poaching is the greatest threat to Tigers range-wide.Asia is a densely populated and rapidly developing region, bringing huge pressures to bear on the large wild areas required for viable Tiger populations. Conversion of forest land to agriculture and silviculture, commercial logging, and human settlement are the main drivers of Tiger habitat loss. With their substantial dietary requirements, Tigers require a healthy large ungulate prey base, but these species are also under heavy human subsistence hunting pressure and competition from domestic livestock.Tiger attacks on livestock and people can lead to intolerance of Tigers by neighbouring communities and presents an ongoing challenge to managers to build local support for Tiger conservation and can lead to high rates of retaliatory killing of Tigers. In some areas there have been many human deaths - for example, about 40 people were killed by Tigers in the Sundarbans mangrove forest of Bangladesh and India 2000-2010 (Barlow et al. 2013).   ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

According to surveys by WCS in Nuristan during 2006-2007 and 2008 (WCS 2008), Markhor continue to be the most important game for local hunters (despite a nominal nationwide ban on hunting). Petocz and Larsson (1977) wrote that rangelands and forests were likely capable of supporting a higher Markhor population than that observed. They assumed that impact of livestock grazing on habitat conditions was limited because the number of domestic animals was restricted by the area's capacity to produce and store winter fodder, as heavy snowfall prevents winter grazing. Recent numbers of livestock are unknown for Nuristan, but recent increases associated with an expanding human population may create competition for forage (WCS 2008). According to a study using recent satellite imagery (Delattre and Rahmani 2007) no large-scale deforestation of the coniferous forests was observed in Markhor habitat in Afghanistan. However, the extent of deforestation for the last five years in a region affected by war and largely out of state control is unknown.In India, all Markhor populations are small (usually < 50) and fragmented. The largest population, in Kajinag, may have potential for long-term survival if immediate conservation measures can be implemented. Key threats to the Markhor’s range are insurgency-related effects, intensified local resource use, poaching, and large-scale development. Poaching by professional hunters may have been the primary cause of decimation of Markhor in the past, but communal hunting during winter was practised until recently. Armed conflicts may have increased poaching by both the military and militants, while poaching by local people may have declined due to confiscation of arms and restriction on human movements. Other pressures come from habitat encroachment by camps of Gujjars and the armed forces, excessive livestock grazing by local and nomadic Bakkarwal herders in parts of the range, and collection of timber and other forest products. Large scale development includes the proposed Mughal road connecting the state capital Srinagar with Rajouri, which passes through the Hirpura Wildlife Sanctuary, and limestone and gypsum mining around Limbar and Lacchipora Wildlife Sanctuaries. The Indian Government has fenced the entire Line of Control with multi-layered barbed wire. This may have caused further fragmentation of populations of Markhor (Bhatnagar et al. 2009). In Pakistan, control of poaching in Chitral Gol National Park and in several community-based conservancies has been successful. There, the population is stable or increasing. However, many subpopulations of Flare-horned Markhor are still small (< 100) and the level of connectivity between them is unknown. The major threat outside established conservancies is poaching. Capra falconeri heptneriIn Afghanistan, interviews suggested that within Markhor range overhunting is a considerable problem, with little capacity for enforcement of the national hunting ban (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012). As a result, Markhor appear to be under threat due to unsustainable hunting. (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012) Poaching in adjacent areas of Tajikistan is reported to threaten the source population of Markhor in Shahr-e Buzurg District (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, Michel et al. 2014).In Tajikistan, Markhor are poached for meat. There are published reports of skins and horns of about 100 poached Markhor being detected in a camp of Afghan poachers in Tajikistan (Michel 2010). According to Moheb and Mostafawi (2011), hunters in northern Shahr-e Buzurg in Afghanistan told numerous stories of groups of hunters going to Tajikistan to poach, and they showed horns and two skins said to originate from there. Because of remoteness, logistical hurdles and lack of security, the international border in this area remains difficult to control.  Cross-border poaching affects the security situation for game wardens, researchers, tourists, and legal foreign hunters and thus jeopardizes the conservation of Markhor in the Dashtijum Strict Nature Reserve and adjacent areas. A recent report (Alidodov et al. 2014) suggests that in some areas poaching is mainly targeted at mature males (including illegal trophy hunting, Vaisman et al. 2014), and that there is a low proportion of adult males (4-5% of the total number, compared to above 20% in other areas). Habitat quality has deteriorated in some locations due to excessive and poorly regulated fuel wood cutting and intensive grazing.In Turkmenistan, increasing grazing of goats and intense poaching threaten Markhor (Lukarevski 2002), whereas Weinberg et al. (1997b) reported that in 1995 grazing and illegal hunting seemed well controlled in Kugitang Strict Nature Reserve.In Uzbekistan, Markhor are now largely restricted to the Surkhan State Strict Nature Reserve and its buffer zone. Despite their protected status, illegal cutting of trees and shrubs, livestock grazing, and poaching were reported (UNDP 2007). No specific information on the current status of these threats is available, but recent Markhor population data (Xoliqov 2013) suggest that the threats are controlled, at least to some extent.Capra falconeri megacerosValdez (2008) reported that in Afghanistan excessive hunting by local people and forage competition with livestock were pushing Markhor to the periphery of its range. Such severe pressure was leading the population to a slow demise, and its status is unlikely to have improved since.In Pakistan, the most important threat to subpopulations outside the Torghar Conservancy is illegal hunting. Other threats include competition with livestock, risk of disease transmission from livestock (Woodford et al. 2004), habitat degradation, and habitat loss (Sheikh and Molur 2004). According to Hess et al. (1997), significant habitat loss was caused by logging in the Sulaiman Range, which they considered the most important area of straight-horned Markhor’s distribution. No recent data on the Markhor in the Sulaiman range are available and recent satellite images from 2011 and 2013 (Google Earth, accessed 2014) suggest that habitat conditions in the Sulaiman range are still largely suitable for Markhor.Another threat for all Markhor subspecies may be posed by the spillover of contagious diseases from domestic goats and other livestock sharing Markhor habitat. Contagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia (CCPP), a contagious, lethal disease to caprids, perhaps overlooked for long time in the north of Pakistan, was recently confirmed to be present in domestic goats in Gilgit-Baltistan and south-western Tajikistan (Peyraud et al. 2014). Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capricolum, an infectious bacterium hosted by domestic goats, killed at least 64 Markhor in fall 2010 in one area in Tajikistan (Ostrowski et al. 2011). In India diseases such as foot and mouth disease are reportedly common in livestock and can infect Markhor (Ranjitsinh et al. 2007).Hybridization with domestic goats may be a potential threat for all subspecies as goats commonly graze in Markhor habitats. Hammer et al. (2008) found introgressive hybridization with domestic goat among 35.7% of Markhor from three zoos, and speculated that in some cases introgressed wild living ancestral C. falconeri herds may have been the source populations of captive Markhor.

Predation by Long-tailed Jaegers and Snowy Owls occasionally occurs (Rausch and Rausch 1968).

On the other hand, damage on forestry and agriculture by sika deer (Cervus nippon), wild boar (Sus scrofa), and Japanese monkey (Macaca fuscata) has remarkably increased, and accordingly social demands to control serow had decreased.

The principal causes of habitat destruction are slash-and-burn agriculture practiced by highlanders and shifting cultivators, and the indiscriminate extraction of timber for export to the West. Poaching is not uncommon, and serows are caught in snares set for other game species, as well as shot, for local consumption of the meat, and for use of body parts in traditional medicines.  Hunting occurs inside and outside of protected areas.  Sources living around protected areas in Sumatra, such as the Gunung Leuser National Park, Aceh, claim that hunting continues to increase as illegal logging roads have opened up parts of the park, allowing access to previously inaccessible areas. Locals claim that populations of this species are in decline.  Trade of parts, especially the horns, is carried out openly in some places, such as in the town of Pancur Batu, North Sumatra.  No enforcement action against individuals trading in Serow parts has taken place in these locations.Threats in Malaysia come mainly from disturbance and from habitat destruction caused by mining activities in the limestone and quartz ridge quarries within their habitat, and by deforestation of the hill dipterocarp forests for logging and agriculture. Serows also suffer from substantial poaching for its meat and body parts that are used for medicinal purposes. In Malaysia, a number of small populations exist, but are threatened by illegal hunting, with this species sometimes being a target, not just an opportunistic kill.  In Malaysia, this species does appear to be tolerant of some human disturbance, and in some areas, occurs very near human habitation.  Over the past two years, enforcement authorities have taken action against individuals involved in illegal hunting of this species, and as a result, trade in this species is not carried out openly, as it is in other Southeast Asian range States.  Very little information on current populations of this species exists.  However, local people living near serow habitat state that populations may be declining, due to hunting and due to quarrying of limestone and quartz areas.

Indeed, recent data indicates that there has been a considerable upsurge in the hunting of this species. An estimated 2,500-3,000 individuals are hunted per year in Makira.

Within some protected areas, serow populations may approach maximum densities of 2 animals/km². However, its apparent preferred habitat of steep, thickly vegetated slopes, is so patchily distributed that overall densities are low and serow is relatively rare throughout its range. Serow habitat is generally at higher elevations than the areas of intensive agriculture in the western Himalaya. Here, and in the eastern Himalaya (where cultivation is less extensive anyway), hunting is apparently the most importance influence on serow populations.Habitat disturbance and poaching are the greatest threats to its survival in Bangladesh, both related to slash and burn (jhoom) cultivation (Khan, 1985).The main threat in China is probably hunting. Although officially 64% of Bhutan remains forested, the figure is probably closer to 50% (Sargent, 1985), making deforestation one of the main threats to the forest-dwelling serow. Serow requires denser habitat than goral and hence is likely to be more susceptible to deforestation and removal of understory vegetation. In winters with heavy snowfalls, avalanches can cause considerable mortality within some serow populations.

Stuart (1982) recorded that over the years 1931-1952 an average of 2,219 Caracals per year were killed in control operations in the Karoo, South Africa. Similarly, Namibian farmers responding to a government questionnaire reported killing up to 2,800 Caracals in 1981 (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Brand (1989) found that Caracals were responsible for the loss of up to 5.3 domestic stock per 100 km² per annum in the former Cape Province of South Africa. Severity of depredation appears to be dependent on the availability of wild prey and husbandry techniques (Stuart and Stuart 2013).Habitat destruction (agriculture and desertification) is a significant threat in central, west, north and northeast Africa where Caracals are naturally sparsely distributed (Ray et al. 2005). It is also likely to be the main threat in the Asian part of its range (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).On the Arabian Peninsula, habitat loss and fragmentation due to road and settlement expansion are major threats (Mallon and Budd 2011). However, also retaliation killing due to livestock predation is a threat (Mallon and Budd 2011). Additionally, prey base declines could negatively affect the Caracal too (Mallon and Budd 2011). In the United Arab Emirates, Caracals are found in the international pet trade. However, the source of these animals and the impact of this trade on the population are unknown (Mallon and Budd 2011).In parts of Turkey, people dislike the species and persecute it because they think it predates on small stock animals (Albayrak et al. 2012). Around Termessos National Park Caracals also get killed in road accidents (Albayrak et al. 2012).In Iran, major threats are attacks by herd dogs and road kills (Ghoddousi et al. 2009). In Afghanistan, hunting pressure and habitat loss due to the extension of agriculture are major threats causing population decline (Habibi 2004). In India, habitat loss and fragmentation and increased human disturbance are the main threats to the Caracal (Kolipaka 2011).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Such activities may sometimes occur within the boundaries of conservation areas: mortality due to wire snares set to catch wild herbivores for meat is an important cause of adult mortality in the Serengeti, where snares kill around 400 adult Spotted Hyaenas each year and are responsible for more than half of all adult mortality (Hofer et al. 1996). Apparently only since the mid-1970s has game meat hunting rapidly expanded, as more people have moved within walking distance of the boundaries of protected areas such as in the north and west of the Serengeti (Hofer 1998). Entire clans of Spotted Hyaenas may be killed by poisoning (Holekamp et al. 1993), and many individuals are killed when hit by vehicles. Spotted Hyaena populations in protected areas may be decimated by authorities when they are considered a threat for other wildlife species such as lions, cheetahs and rhinos. Government officials and managers may also allow local human residents within protected areas to kill Spotted Hyaenas when they are suspected or known to have preyed upon livestock. The numbers killed by licensed sport hunters are probably small as they are not considered an attractive species. It is also killed for food, medicine and witchcraft (Hofer and Mills 1998b).

Collection of firewood in the area has also resulted in deforestation. However, it is not known to what degree these threats are affecting the species (some mole-rats adapt well to agricultural disturbance). The threats to the species in Cameroon are not known. There has been land degradation on Jos plateau as a result of excessive tin mining (Musa and Jiya 2011). This species is likely to lose climate suitability (Baker and Willis 2014), with climate change in Nigeria causing aridiation of the northeast, southward encroachment of Sahara desert which is making the northern regions unproductive and forcing migration of people and agriculture southwards causing further deforestation and land degradation by grazing (Fasona and Omojola 2005).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

It is sometimes persecuted as a pest. In central Europe the population was formerly severely reduced by rabies, but that threat has now decreased with rabies controls. In the United Kingdom the species is associated with bovine TB, which has lead to local trials to remove it. During hunting for Red Fox Vulpe vulpes or (introduced) Northern Raccoon Procyon lotor, Eurasian Badger is often killed as by-catch. In the Russian Federation the species is sometimes hunted for meat and fat, used as medicine. In Germany, it is hunted annually. It is possible that the introduced Raccoon Dog Nyctereutes procyonoides competes with Eurasian Badger, and a project in Finland is looking into this possible threat. It was initiated by the Finnish Game and Fisheries Research Institute, started in 2006 and should continue for about four years (Kauhala in litt. 2006). Badgers are heavily hunted in Finland; the annual harvest has increased in recent years, being about 10,000 badgers by 2006(Kauhala in litt. 2006).

During the 1960s much forest on Bawean was replaced by teak plantations; coupled with increased hunting pressure, this probably caused the species to decline in numbers. Hunting ceased in 1977, and the population increased during the next few years (Anonymous 1978, Blouch and Sumaryoto 1987, G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2006). The hunting of pigs Sus scrofa with dogs persists, and leads to inadvertent death of deer (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2006), but at the population level hunting is no longer a threat (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008). Presently, fewer than five deer die per year through direct human influence, chiefly in traffic accidents and when being chased by local dogs during pig hunts (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008). Maturation of teak (including coppicing from cut stumps) and invasion by the American herb Chromolaena odorata; Compositae (=Eupatorium odoratum) constitute the only significant predictable threat to this deer, through reducing the grazing areas and this carrying capacity (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2013). Pigs (Sus spp.) may be impacting the re-growth of grass and other foodplants in grazing areas, which could pose a threat to the Bawean Deer population (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2014) but this is not confirmed. For a population at best on the edge of the oft-quoted, though somewhat arbitrary, minimum figure for a population viable into the long term (500), such a further reduction (on top of the major contraction in available habitat for the species over past centuries) should be seen as a major threat despite recent population stability.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Both of these groups may also sell any surplus meat as venison in local markets or to speciality restaurants; whereas local hunters from upland communities also specialize in live-captures to meet strong demand for these animals as pets (particularly amongst local politicians). Many of these are supplied by the orphans of hunter-killed animals, though almost all such captive stocks also include animals captured as adults in leg snares, as evidenced by the amputation of their lower limbs.There is continuing severe habitat fragmentation and reduction of populations from illegal logging and agricultural expansion, and some populations are now so reduced in size as to be of doubtful viability.

EXOTIC SPECIES/DISEASE: Sylvatic plague was introduced to North America around 1899 (Cully 1989) and first reported in black-tailed prairie dogs from Texas in the mid-1940s (Reading et al. 1989). It is a serious threat given its pervasiveness and efficacy, as it can kill more than 99% of prairie dogs in a colony (Cully 1989), and numbers do not appear to fully recover (USFWS 2002). Though prairie dogs have persisted in the presence of plague since about 1900 and prairie dog numbers are high given habitat loss and control efforts, plague is still of concern to local populations and for long-term persistence. Plague is not well documented in black-tailed prairie dogs across their range though there is no reason to believe that plague is not as significant in black-tailed as it is in white-tailed prairie dogs (Cully 1992). On large areas originally selected as possible ferret reintroduction sites, declines of up to 90 per cent from about 1985-2000 are ""generally attributed to sylvatic plague"" (USFWS 2000). Only about 10 percent of the historical range is both plague-free and available (not cropland) (USFWS 2000). Widespread outbreaks in 2001 may indicate the beginning of an 'up' cycle in plague occurrence (USFWS 2002). The significance of plague in range-wide prairie dog mortality is unclear, though experts agree that where plague occurs it is extremely important in population dynamics (Cully 1992). Plague may be introduced into a colony by other species or by dispersing prairie dogs, which bring plague-ridden fleas into a colony.USFWS (2004) noted that: (1) High exposure doses of plague bacilli may be necessary for disease contraction in some individuals; (2) limited immune response has been observed in some individuals; (3) a population dynamic may have developed in low-density, isolated populations that contributes to the persistence of these populations; (4) the apparent ability of some sites to recover to pre-plague levels after a plague epizootic; and (5) approximately one-third of the species' historic range has not been affected by plague. Based on this and on recent estimates of occupied habitat, USFWS (2004) concluded that plague no longer appears to be as significant a threat as previously thought and that plague in combination with other factors is not likely to cause the black-tailed prairie dog to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future.HABITAT LOSS AND DEGRADATION: Habitat loss has been an important factor in prairie dog declines in the past. Cheatheam (1977) estimated that about 36% of the land area in regions used by prairie dogs was covered by water developments, urban expansion, cropland, and improved pasture. Similarly, Bishop and Culbertson (1976) detected extensive colony loss on river terraces as a result of farming activities. Conversion of native prairie to farmland does not necessarily represent habitat loss to prairie dogs, but farmers will not tolerate prairie dogs in their fields (Merriam 1902). Similarly, prairie dogs prosper in empty urban lots and fields, yet this is not often tolerated given the plague risk. However, in New Mexico, urban (Gunnison's) prairie dogs are often allowed to remain because colony fleas are killed instead. Still, developments that destroy patches of grassland (e.g., roads, buildings, water impoundments) result in loss of potential prairie dog habitat and restriction of area for colony expansion.  USFWS (2004) concluded that present or threatened habitat destruction is not a threat to the species, although considerable effects due to this factor have occurred in the past. Additionally, USFWS concluded that present or threatened habitat modification as it relates to plague is not a significant threat to the species.CONTROL: Control by humans, interacting with low forage production, is probably the main cause of loss of the prairie dog from the more arid parts of its range, including southwest New Mexico and southeast Arizona (Cully 1992) and Texas (see map in Cheatheam 1977). For most of the 20th century, Animal Damage Control, its forerunners, and other control agencies worked hard to eliminate prairie dogs over wide areas (Cully 1992). Towns were poisoned primarily with strychnine and zinc-phosphide baits (e.g., oats mixed with rodenticide). Poisoning was immediately followed up with extermination of any remaining living prairie dogs (Cully 1992). Indeed, control efforts, with some help from plague, resulted in a reduction in prairie dog acreage from 700,000,000 to 1,500,000 in 1971 (Cain et al. 1971, in Fagerstone and Biggins 1986; Cully 1989). Today prairie dog poisoning efforts are limited to local, problem populations and entail control, not extermination. Public control agencies, including ADC, do very little prairie dog control work, as most control is practiced by land managers. These agencies do provide technical information and assistance, however.USFWS (2004) acknowledged extant and potentially significant local population reductions due to chemical control of prairie dogs but concluded that impacts due to this factor are not a threat to the extent that the species could become endangered in the foreseeable future.USFWS (2004) acknowledged that recreational shooting can reduce population densities at specific sites and that extirpation possibly may have occurred in isolated circumstances due to this factor. However, USFWS noted that populations can recover from very low numbers following intensive recreational shooting and therefore concluded that effects due to recreational shooting do not constitute a significant threat.Distribution, abundance, and trend data indicate that inadequate regulatory mechanisms are not limiting black-tailed prairie dog populations at present, nor are they likely to within the foreseeable future (USFWS 2004).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Macroderma gigas is very  vulnerable to disturbance in its roost sites, and will readily fly into  daylight following the casual entry of the public or searches by  biologists, where it is vulnerable to predation by raptors and general  exposure to the external environment. Some of the known roosts readily  accessible by people are not managed. Bats may not return to a roost for  months or years after trapping activity, depending on how this is  undertaken. The most serious threat is the loss of roost sites, which  can occur from a variety of causes. Renewed interest in economic  reserves of remaining ore beneath historical mine workings has the  potential to cause disturbances and loss of habitat, and there has been  recent evidence of this in the Pilbara region. There is also an  increasing level of encroachment on cave roosts in ironstone habitats by  surface mining and associated exploration activity. The collapse,  flooding and blocking of entrances are realistic sources of potential  catastrophic loss to the large colonies that have been established in  historical and disused gold and copper mines. There has also been recent  evidence that cane toads contribute to the mortality of M. gigas, and  there are other unknown factors that appear to have caused very recent  but patchy declines in the Northern Territory (White et al. 2016). Genetic studies have demonstrated that it is potentially susceptible to cane toad toxin (Shine et al.  2016). Entanglement in barbed wire fences is known to have caused local  declines in the Pilbara after the ongoing entanglement of entire small  colonies (Armstrong and Anstee 2000). Pollution in old mines and an  unidentified herpes virus have also been identified as possible threats  (Woinarski et al. 2014). For the populations at the southern  limits of the species' range, the general paucity of suitable roost  sites, the geographic distance between existing colonies, and the  evident complete lack of gene flow indicates that these populations are  totally isolated and will not be rescued by immigration or recolonised  should local extinctions occur (Worthington Wilmer et al. 1999).  They can be captured inadvertently in pit traps used for small  terrestrial vertebrate surveys, depending on the width of the pit mouth  (Diete et al. 2016).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

However, now that the species has recovered and numbers are increasing, the only significant threats are hybridisation with the Blue Wildebeest, which can occur when the two species are mixed unnaturally on fenced land (East 1999, Grobler et al. 2011); and loss of genetic diversity from existing in isolated fenced areas, leading to isolation from the wider gene pool of the species. The effects of fragmentation and isolation may be increased by small founder population size. Both threats require a Biodiversity Management Plan and the formulation of a metapopulation strategy.Black and Blue Wildebeest are two distinct species and do not interbreed naturally because they occupy different habitats (for example, Black Wildebeest cannot reproduce in habitats with extensive tree cover), although there may have historically been hybrid zones with flux in movement patterns. Fossil evidence and historical records suggest that the two species have a long history of sympatric occurrence in central southern Africa (Brink et al. 1999, Skead 2011). It is likely that reproductive isolation would have been in effect following the speciation of Black Wildebeest and that it remained intact until extensive habitat loss in the central interior of southern Africa (Brink 2005). This started in the early 19th century, but the skeletal evidence for hybridisation is seen only very recently, since the 1990s. This may be linked to increased levels of habitat loss and disturbance as these two species have been forced into sustained sympatry which may have led to artificial inflation of hybridisation frequency. The occurrence of Black x Blue Wildebeest hybrids (cross-breeds) was first reported in KZN in the early sixties. First generation hybrids are easily identified, but the offspring of hybrids that have interbred with pure Black Wildebeest are difficult to recognize on appearance alone. Hybrids are fertile (Fabricius et al. 1988, Ackermann et al. 2010). In several cases it appears that a disruption of the normal demographic/social structure has been involved as well. An example of this was reported for Spioenkop Nature Reserve (Langley 1995). A morphometric analysis of skeletal materials housed in the Florisbad Quaternary Research Department, which were collected from Free State provincial nature reserves over the last decade, revealed a high incidence of skull and tarsus abnormalities which might be linked to historical incidences of hybridisation (J. Brink unpubl. data). Further data is required to corroborate the extent and severity of hybridisation in formally protected areas. The threat of hybridisation, however, can be managed. As long as hybridisation is not allowed to occur on national or provincial protected areas, and the establishment of private protected areas continues to counter the loss of habitat through agriculture and mining, this species should continue to prosper.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

In recent years about 4,000 have been taken annually in Arizona, and about 1,000 in New Mexico. In Texas 45,000~50,000 Ringtails were trapped each year from 1979 to 1985. As with raccoons, the number of Ringtails trapped for fur has declined since a peak in 1979, when approximately 135,000 pelts were sold. Ringtail fur is of poor quality (thin, non-durable, and subject to fading), and pelts have usually sold for less than US$5 each although they have brought as much as US$12. The justification for trapping Ringtails for fur is weak, especially because in none of the states where trapping is legal is there sufficient knowledge of population levels and trends on which to base valid harvest regulations (Glatston 1994).

The majority of the habitat will likely remain unchanged as it lives in rocky areas inaccessible to transformation. However, climate change is projected to make higher-altitude habitats more suitable for agriculture. For example, the suitability of upslope habitats for viticulture is projected to increase the footprint of winelands by 14% by 2050 (Hannah et al. 2013).

Ground-living small carnivores are exposed to high levels of non-specific hunting, particularly with snares, throughout most of northern South-east Asia, both inside and outside protected areas (e.g., Coudrat et al. 2014, B. Kanchanasaka pers. comm. 2006). Dogs, which among many ethnic groups in this species's range invariably accompany people entering the forest for any reason, not just on hunting-specific trips, are widely likely to be a problem for this ground-dwelling species, even though it is largely within burrows by day. In the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh, local people kill Large Indian Civets (for meat consumption) with poison (S. Chakma per H. Rahman pers. comm. 2014).Forest conversion to uses such as agriculture has been variably heavy across the species's range, and reduces the potential population of this species, and fragmentation facilitates access by hunters and exacerbates the effects of hunting. Because it has a large range in hill forests on rugged terrain, which have much lower clearance rates than do forests on level lowlands, it has lost a lower proportion of its habitat than has the lowland relative Large-spotted Civet V. megaspila. In most of its range, certainly Viet Nam, Lao PDR and China, hunting is the more pervasive threat because large areas of suitable habitat are now empty of the species or nearly so. By contrast, in the better protected areas of Thailand, Myanmar and widely in its range further west, where the species remains common, habitat is more likely to be limiting. The various recent peri-urban records from Nepal (Kathmandu), albeit all within 1-3 km of native forest, contrast strongly with the situation in today's Lao PDR and Viet Nam, where it is now probably largely restricted to the more remote areas.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Budorcas taxicolor whiteiWith almost no management or protection in the remote border areas of China, over-hunting by local people is hard to control, and hunting of large herds in winter is reported to be a serious problem (Feng et al., 1986). In Bhutan, threats include competition and disease transmission from domestic livestock, habitat loss (pasture burning), and loss or disruption of migration routes. In India, major threats come primarily from habitat loss resulting from activities such as timber harvesting, cane and bamboo cutting and road construction, all associated with human populations that continue to encroach on areas occupied by takin. Local people are also known to hunt takin regularly, both within and outside protected areas. Recent surveys of takin found evidence of hunting in the Siang Valley and Kamlang Wildlife Sanctuary but only limited sign of the animals themselves, whereas in Mehao Wildlife Sanctuary, considerable numbers of takin tracks and droppings, and evidence of hunting were found (Katti et al., 1990). Current levels of hunting by local residents may not represent a significant influence on takin populations (Katti et al., 1990).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

A high demand for bushmeat stems from the growing human population, the destabilising impact of armed groups, artisanal miners in remote areas and a general scarcity of affordable domestic protein in rural areas. The permanent presence of people who provide the workforce for exploitation of natural resources also constitutes a major factor in this problem. Miners working in national parks have admitted to poaching Gorillas, which are relatively easy to hunt with guns and provide large quantities of meat (Kirkby et al. 2015). Illegal capture of live infants is a secondary threat (after the mother has been killed and eaten), except on occasions when Mountain Gorilla infants have been the principle target, fulfilling the demands of a fictitious, international market. These orphans usually die or are seized by the wildlife authorities.Habitat loss and degradation - Agricultural and pastoral activities are leading to continued loss and fragmentation of Gorilla habitat in DRC. At present, there is no commercial logging in the Eastern Gorilla’s range, but there is continuous artisanal extraction of resources, which puts added stress on natural habitats. Illegal mining has decimated the lowlands of Kahuzi-Biega National Park, a Grauer’s Gorilla stronghold. Destruction of forest for timber, charcoal production and agriculture continues to threaten the isolated Gorilla populations that persist in North Kivu and the Itombwe Massif.Civil unrest - For two decades, refugees, internally-displaced people and numerous armed groups have placed enormous pressure on DRC’s forests through uncontrolled habitat conversion for farmland, harvesting of firewood, timber extraction and mining. Ongoing political unrest and military activity, including rebel occupation of national parks have compounded other threats (Yamagiwa 2003, Plumptre et al. 2016). A recent survey identified 69 armed groups operating in North and South Kivu (Stearns & Vogel 2015), covering important portions of remaining Grauer’s Gorilla range. Armed conflict and the collapse of law and order in DRC brought a significant rise in the illegal circulation of military weapons and ammunition. Former traditional hunters have obtained guns, notably AK47s, and the commercial trade in bushmeat increased with the spread of firearms, often supplied by government soldiers and rebel militia. During the 1990s and early 2000s, the Virunga Mountain Gorillas were also impacted by war and instability (Kalpers et al. 2003, Robbins et al. 2011).Disease - Regulated tourism is a key strategy for Eastern Gorilla conservation; however, transmission of human diseases is a major concern (Gilardi et al. 2015), as is excessive disturbance to Gorillas and their habitat (Macfie and Williamson 2010), which could jeopardize conservation programmes. Examples of likely or proven human-­to-­great ape disease transmission include respiratory viruses (Köndgen et al. 2008, Palacios et al. 2011, Spelman et al. 2013), human herpes simplex virus (Gilardi et al. 2014) and scabies (Kalema-Zikusoka et al. 2002). Some of these cases have been fatal and most have involved habituated Gorillas or Chimpanzees. Nonetheless, Mountain Gorillas visited by researchers and tourists have consistently shown higher population growth rates than unhabituated Gorillas, which is likely due to the daily monitoring of habituated groups. Continuous monitoring leads to better protection and facilitates veterinary interventions to remove snares and treat respiratory illnesses (Robbins et al. 2011); it is almost impossible to treat unhabituated Gorillas.Climate change - Climate change is predicted to impact the forests of the Albertine Rift escarpment, leading to the upslope migration of species and key Gorilla habitat, notably montane forest (Ayebare et al. 2013). Increased temperatures and modified rainfall patterns are also likely to result in changes in food availability and habitat quality (McGahey et al. 2013). With almost all montane forest in the eastern highlands now destroyed and converted for agriculture to support some of the highest human population densities in the African Great Lakes region, climate change may have negative effects on food security for the human populations surrounding Gorilla habitat, which could also conservation efforts in the future.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In some areas, fires set for agriculture are a threat to the species' habitat. Cattle ranching and farming activities pose a number of threats, including the risk of diseases spreading to the Tamaraw from livestock and burning of pastures leading to a reduced number of palatable grass species. Historically, Tamaraw were hunted for both subsistence and sport, which led to a period of drastic decline in numbers of individuals and populations (Rabor 1977). Hunting was carefully regulated prior to World War II, but since then a growing human population, logging operations, ranching, and widespread availability of firearms on Mindoro have caused a dramatic decline in numbers (Talbot and Talbot 1966). Since the 1980s, sport hunting has reduced due to a decline in the Tamaraw population, closure of nearby ranches, and more intensive patrolling and awareness activities since the establishment of the protected area. International trade in this species or its derivatives has not been reported. Although protected by law, the illegal capture and killing of this species continues.Nowadays the main threat to the species stands in the lack of options for the remaining tamaraw populations to disperse and increase their range due to human pressure and shortage of undisturbed natural corridors (Schütz 2015). Poaching and illegal activities from lowlander Mindorenos pose a serious problem for wildlife. Besides this, traditional hunting activities from local indigenous communities in Tamaraw areas are a serious source of disturbance and possible cause of injury to tamaraw even if the species is not targeted (pit fall trap, snare trap). Moreover, land-use pressure from local indigenous communities is generally increasing in Mindoro due to population growth and incapability of those people to expand in lowland areas that are now occupied by new settlers.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Within India, hybridization between this species and Ratufa indica is considered to be a major threat to remaining populations (Joshua 1996).  In areas of India where the size of subpopulations have increased, conflict with farmers has increased to the point where crops are being seriously damaged and has resulted in the farmers targeting the squirrels as a pest species (J. Joshua pers. comm. 2016). The Sri Lankan subpopulations are also targeted by farmers as a pest species (Goonatilake pers. comm. 2016).

Patterns of threat vary across the species' range. Viet Nam, Lao PDR and to a lesser extent Cambodia and northern Thailand are apparently the areas where mammal hunting has been heaviest. In its mainland China range, rates may be even higher, because a recent fire-arm ban is said to have pushed up levels of gin-trapping (B.P.L. Chan pers. comm. 2008). Muntjacs are hunted within a thriving hunting and wildlife trading culture in this area and in adjacent countries such as China and Thailand, involving many land vertebrate species, along with other forest products such as orchids and Aquilaria resin (e.g. Compton and Le Hai Quang 1998, Compton et al. 1999, Noreen and Claridge 2001). Such hunting reaches all areas, although in large rugged mountain forest blocks trade-driven hunting of species valued only for their meat (rather than high-value, low-weight, generally medicinal products that can be carried out efficiently from even the remotest areas) is still limited by economics of accessibility. The regional wild meat trade has little likelihood of abating as long as there are any pigs, muntjacs, and civets to be hunted. The human population of Viet Nam is more than 90 million, that of China more than 1,000 million. Together, they comprise an enormous market for wildlife products. For example, tens of millions of wild turtles are imported, legally and illegally, into China annually (van Dijk et al. 2000). There has been no comparable study of ungulate trade levels. Within the Northern and Central Annamites, every square kilometre of Viet Namese forest and of Lao forest that is within 5 km of the Viet Namese border probably has snares capable of capturing muntjacs set in it every year (Timmins et al. 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Intensity in some areas probably reaches many thousands of snare-nights per square kilometre per year (Timmins et al. 2007). Snaring is less intensive in Lao PDR at least away from the Viet Namese border, but is increasing dramatically (Timmins and Robichaud 2005, W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins 2007, Coudrat et al. 2014, Timmins and Duckworth 2012, R.J. Timmins in press b, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Hunting intensity had in recent decades been generally lower in southern Viet Nam than in Lao PDR and northern Viet Nam, leaving many wildlife populations less depleted (e.g. Le Xuan Canh et al. 1997, Timmins and Duckworth 2000, Polet and Ling 2004), but the general increase in regional hunting intensity and economic wealth indicate that hunting intensity in this region must also be increasing (Timmins et al. 2008), as of 2014 there are indications that hunting intensity has reached equivalent levels to the north, at least in some areas (Timmins in press a). In northern Thailand when muntjacs become rare, the animals are hunted in group drives, the meat is often sold (Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002).Closed tropical evergreen forests have inherently low ungulate biomass (Robinson and Bennett 2000), and beyond this populations of all wild animals larger than 20 kg in Indochina have been significantly reduced by human exploitation (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins et al. 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Field survey encounter rates with Northern Red Muntjacs in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and Cambodia are remarkably low compared with other areas in its range (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins et al. 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). In a recent reconnaissance survey of highly fragmented habitat in southern Lao PDR (Pathoumphon district, Champasak province), outside the protected area system, muntjac were the only ungulates (assumed to relate to this species on habitat and distribution) for which signs were commonly found, even wild pigs Sus sp(p). being noticeably more scarce (K. Khounboline and J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). This pattern is general throughout Lao PDR (K. Khounboline pers. comm. 2008). However, areas of heavy hunting have lost muntjacs or had them reduced to extreme rarity, not only forest isolates such as Houay Nhang (a few square kilometres,, just outside Vientiane, Duckworth et al. 1994) but also, where hunting has been extremely heavy, less fragmented landscapes (such as the western lowlands of Xe Bang-Nouan National Protected Area in south Lao PDR, J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). In such areas, even though forest within them is in general heavily degraded, habitat is unlikely to be the prime cause of decline, because in some other areas of long-standing forest devastation now dominated by a mix of secondary ruderals, shrubs and grasses, muntjacs are still relatively common, e.g. Phongsali (far northern Lao PDR), where they can even still be heard from the provincial capital town (Duckworth and Robichaud 2005). Similarly, Red Muntjac is common and widespread in Hong Kong, an almost deforested landscape (Chek 2006, R. Corlett pers. comm. 2008), and studies in Hainan indicated selection of openings and other edge habitats rather than forest interiors (Teng et al. 2004), this seems generally true throughout South-east Asia (R.J. Timmins and J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). There is also evidence from elsewhere in its range that this species is better able than most ungulates to withstand a certain degree of continuous harvesting as well as habitat disturbance (Jathanna et al 2003), although this has rarely been based on quantified status assessment. In Nagarahole National Park, India, Madhusudan and Karanth (2002) found no difference in muntjac abundance between a heavily hunted and a lightly hunted site, compared with enormous differences for most other ungulates. In the context of Indochina, even their heavily-hunted site would, however, rank as lightly hunted (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008, from based on visit and discussion). Madhusudan and Karanth (2002) cautioned against assuming that these results indicated an intrinsic resilience to hunting by this muntjac: it is not so readily hunted as, for example, Chital Axis axis, because of its solitary nature, affinity for dense cover and therefore risks of getting caught are higher when using appropriate techniques to kill or capture it. However, the ubiquitous disparity in status between M. vaginalis and other ungulates (and indeed almost all other mammals of similar or larger body weight) in Indochina indicates that it is truly much more resilient to hunting. Muntjac populations are capable of recovering quickly from overexploitation if hunting is controlled: an overhunted, low density population freed from hunting pressure in Thailand increased 10-fold in 6 years, a rate of increase that is likely near the biological maximum attainable by the species (Steinmetz et al. 2010). An intensive study of hunting on mammals in two Hmong villages of northern Thailand classified quarry species into tiers representing the sequence of loss through overhunting, muntjacs (most or all were presumably M. vaginalis) fell in the fifth tier, persisting much longer than all other ruminants and with only species like squirrels, civets, and linsangs being placed later in the extinction sequence (Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002). Even so, villagers reported that muntjacs were greatly reduced in numbers in the area. The strongest demonstration of its remarkable resilience is that it is now common and widespread in Hong Kong, an almost deforested landscape which has in the past sustained hunting and habitat disruption heavy enough to force extinction even of squirrels. Red Muntjac were reduced to very low populations a few decades ago, but did not become extinct, and has increased rapidly in recent years (Shek 2006, R. Corlett pers. comm. 2008).While wild meat is the major driver of South-east Asian muntjac trade, parts such as antlers are also heavily traded (e.g. Duckworth et al. 1999, Noreen and Claridge 2001).Rapid economic development and expanding wealth in the species' range, particularly South-east Asia and China, are increasing the demand for wildlife meat and ‘medicines’ (Timmins et al. 2007). Timmins et al. (2007) highlighted a common misconception, especially in documentation of development projects in the region, that poverty is a principal cause of biodiversity loss, but as they pointed out for Saola Pseudoryx nghetinhensis, the main driver of threats to wild ungulates, at least for the mid-term, is not rural poverty but increasing urban wealth in Indochina and China. Similarly, in Thailand, trade-driven hunting has been the main cause of muntjac and other wildlife population declines, regardless of protected area status (Steinmetz et al. 2006). In Viet Nam “the free market economy has resulted in feverish periods of trade in wild species nationwide, with negative impacts on biodiversity” (Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2004). In Cambodia, the same factor has fostered a thriving bushmeat market and hunting of species for international wildlife trade (Timmins and Ou 2001, Maxwell et al. 2006, Timmins 2006). There is a rapid, ongoing, expansion of wealthy social strata in Lao PDR, directly accelerated by illegal trade in rosewood, wild meat, and other forest resources, and by the economics of large infrastructure projects (e.g. Nan Theun 2 hydro-electric power project), creating a significantly greater in-country demand for luxury meats such as venison (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2007). Wild meat is chosen in preference to farmed meat despite a greater price per unit weight (e.g. Hansel 2004). Markets along major roads such as route 13 (e.g. at Ban Namthon) have expanded, not contracted, in the last 15 years and have a huge (albeit unquantified) turnover of wild meat, at this specific market, multiple stalls are selling dried muntjac meat daily (balance of muntjac species unknown). The effects of hunting in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Thailand have been exacerbated during the last two decades by habitat loss and various socio-economic factors, of which the most biologically significant are discussed in the Red List account for Large-antlered Muntjac M. vuquangensis.Thus, even though this is one of the most resilient of large mammals in Indochina persisting in fragmented landscapes and often in peripheral forest areas, populations in Indochina (Viet Nam, Lao PDR and Cambodia) are likely to be declining significantly (perhaps at a level to trigger VU i.e. 30% in 10–15 years, for the regional population) (Timmins et al. 2008). Densities especially in Lao PDR and Viet Nam are generally well below carrying capacity, although in extensive areas of Cambodia are likely to be more natural, as they are across the range west of the Mekong (Timmins et al. 2008). Since 2008 rates of decline in Indochina have almost certainly increased and are now quite likely to be in the region of ‘30% in 10–15 years’, especially in Lao and Cambodia where economic growth has seen widespread landscape level changes in infrastructure and land use and concomitant rise in the value of bushmeat and in hunting pressure, although most areas in Vietnam may have already been so depleted prior to 2008 that hunting of residual animals has been relatively difficult since then, thus tempering decline rates, even though hunting intensity has probably increased (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Forest lost estimates before 1990 indicate even a larger net loss (Etter and van Wyngaarden 2000). Currently, there is only 36% of forest cover within the EOO, 35% within the altitudinally suitable EEO, and 25% within the last modelled distribution. These deforestation trends are likely to continue given the historical drivers still operating in the area. The extent of the species's association with forest is, however, unknown, so the relationship of these deforestation statistics to the species's population trend is also unclear. For example, the former could overestimate the latter if the species is not particularly tied to forest, or if densities are higher in degraded and edge areas than in pristine forest; or they could be an underestimate if the species is tied to a particularly rapidly declining microhabitat.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Even though this weasel lacks high economic value, and villagers in at least central Lao PDR say it has a bad taste and smell (C.N.Z. Coudrat pers. comm. 2014), hunting could in theory drive declines because many harvest methods (notably snares) used widely in its range are non-selective. As remaining natural habitats are yet further encroached, the proportion of the species’s occupied area in which it faces such threats will increase. However, the number of records from areas with already high hunting pressure indicate a resilience to such activities (Abramov et al. 2008, Willcox et al. 2014: Table SOM3). This does not mean that hunting-driven declines might not be occurring locally; this is most likely to be so in Viet Nam, looking at patterns of ground-level snaring pressure. Even in this case, the paucity of salvage records from snare lines suggests that weasels are only rarely caught: plausibly they move through the brush-wood drift fences (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014) and, given that the snare-lines usually run across relatively open understorey, weasels perhaps avoid these areas anyway (D.H.A.

Species distribution map and protected area boundaries show evident weaknesses in the existing protected areas network on Mindoro. Anomalies in local legislation pertaining to allowable hunting of threatened versus non-threatened species by local indigenous peoples. Many (perhaps most) of Mindoro’s remaining forest areas are also severely threatened by commercial mining claims and salient ‘pro-mining’ agendas by many of the relevant Philippine governmental authorities. Genetic contamination via hybridization with free-ranging domestic pigs raised by hinterland communities in Mindoro might pose the single most important threat to the genetic integrity of this species (Oliver 1992, Gonzalez et al. 1999, Oliver 2008, W.L.R.Oliver pers. comm. 2014). However, the rate of hybridization has not been studied or evaluated. The species is also widely hunted for food, local bushmeat trade and indigenous cultural ceremonies. Hunting or captures using pit fall trap, snare trap, driven hunt, spear hunt and other methods  was recently observed in many areas (Oliver 2008, Balete et al. 2013, MBCFI 2013, Schütz 2015). Hunting pressure from Mangyan communities in Mt. Calavite are somehow reduced as many indigenous communities there have been converted by missionaries to the Adventist belief which recommends abstinence from red meat including pork. Other non-indigenous, non-Adventist communities are still reported to poach wild pigs. (D.G.Tabaranza pers. obs., MBCFI 2013, E. Schütz pers. obs).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Inferred major threats are severe habitat alteration and fragmentation of Afromontane forest and adjoining grasslands by commercial forestry operations and associated roads infrastructure. Although somewhat limited, expanding rural and urban housing, commercial and tourism infrastructure developments in the last five years have resulted in areas of suitable habitat being cleared or severely transformed.

Fires that are more frequent due to the increase of invasive cheatgrass, conversion to cropland and rangeland are contributors to loss of sagebrush habitat. Isolation of populations due to fragmentation of suitable habitat cause bottlenecks that threaten subpopulations. Dispersal is limited in fragmented populations, because B. idahoensis will not cross large open areas (Dobler and Dixon 1990).Washington: In Washington, B. idahoensis is threatened by loss of deep soil shrub-steppe habitat, increase in fire frequencies due to cheatgrass invasion. Fires have the potential to remove sagebrush from vast areas. A recent fire in Washington State burned 66,000 hectares just outside the historic range of B. idahoensis. There are 417,000 hectares within the historic range of B. idahoensis in Washington with soil types where rabbits have been located. Of that amount, 27,000 acres remain in shrub-steppe today, and much of that has been degraded through fire and agricultural practices. Change in abundance and foraging of native predators due to habitat change are potential threats range wide that are largely unstudied (Hays 2004).Wyoming: Although cheatgrass is not yet a major problem in southwest Wyoming, it is thought to be only a matter of time before it begins to dominate here as it has in states to the west. Also petroleum exploration and development is expected to increase markedly here, with consequent increase in sagebrush removal, alteration of fire cycles, increased road density, and increased potential for cheatgrass and other noxious weed establishment. Habitat managers appear to support more prescribed burning of tall and dense sagebrush, primarily to increase forage for big game and improve habitat for sage grouse. There is only occasional attention being paid to how this might harm B. idahoensis, as well as other vertebrates with similar habitat affinities (e.g. sage thrashers, sage sparrows). Heavy livestock grazing has the potential to reduce habitat quality for B. idahoensis, but it is important to recognize that southwest Wyoming was historically grazed by bison and white-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys leucurus) with the latter species persisting into the present. Grazing by domestic sheep, cattle, horses, and feral horses occurs today, but was probably more intense and pervasive in the early 20th century and B. idahoensis are presumed to have persisted through that period. Disturbance of habitat in the vicinity of Bear Lake (ID) may reduce the already tentative connectivity between Wyoming populations and those to the west (Beauvais 2004).Nevada and California: The main threat to B. idahoensis in Nevada and California is fragmentation due to vast fires. (These fires have extirpated populations from entire valleys and without leaving any cover behind may not allow rabbits to repopulate the area.) This is a severe problem that will most likely become greater with increasing cheatgrass invasion across Nevada. Agricultural fields are also a threat. Not only are they usually placed on the same loamy soils  the rabbits prefer, but they also create a potentially impassable barrier and may increase the habitat suitability for cottontails. Road systems may also be a larger barrier to dispersal that we may think. In night-time road transect surveys in areas with known ratios of jackrabbits/cottontails/B. idahoensis, B. idahoensis was consistently significantly under-represented. This may be due to their reluctance to cross open areas (Sequin 2004).Oregon: Threats to B. idahoensis in Oregon include fire (natural and managed), flooding, conversion to agriculture, exotic plants, decadence and overgrazing. The accumulative effects of the threats have contributed to habitat fragmentation and the isolation of populations (Carey et al. 2004).Utah: The primary threat to B. idahoensis at this time is habitat loss. Loss occurs as a result of human development (historic losses: Wasatch Front north of Salt Lake; current losses: southwestern portion of the state in the vicinity of Cedar City), conversion to cultivated agriculture (northwestern portion of the Great Basin), degradation of plant communities due to overgrazing (widespread), increased fire frequency due to invasive weed understory (Great Basin), and large scale range improvement projects favouring the creation of large openings in mature sagebrush (Wyoming Basin, Lower Wasatch Range). As populations get smaller and more isolated, predators and disease may play more prominent roles as threats (Kozlowski 2004).Idaho: Brachylagus idahoensis is threatened in Idaho by loss and/or modification of habitat including agricultural and urban development, invasive weeds, and changes in fire frequencies (Rachlow 2004b).Montana: Rauscher (1997) mentions fragmentation of B. idahoensis habitat resulting from projects to improve rangeland for cattle as a threat (sagebrush is removed).

Deforestation represents the biggest threat to Pygmy Hippos, with forests within their historical range having been steadily logged, farmed, converted to plantations (rubber, coffee and oil palm) and settled (Christie et al. 2007, Norris et al. 2010). An increase in mining and associated infrastructure development in recent years further threatens the remaining forests. What forest that does remain is fragmented, leaving Pygmy Hippo populations isolated, with demographic consequences and the increased susceptibility of small populations to local extinction (Mallon et al. 2011). Fragmentation has made the forests more accessible for hunters and there is now very little, if any, undisturbed forest in the region safe for wildlife causing the Pygmy Hippo to retreat into the diminishing fragmented parcels of forest (Lewison and Oliver 2008).We quantified loss of forest in the range of the species using the Hansen et al. (2013) forest cover change maps. We used 300 m resolution maps (resampled from the original 30 m resolution to enable calculations to be computationally tractable). We calculated the approximate area of forest cover within the non-extinct portions of the species range in year 2000 (71,435 km2). We then summed the proportional forest loss (negative) and gain (positive) values between 2000-2012, which resulted in an estimate of a 5,010 km2 reduction in forest cover within the range. Note that this calculation assumes that each loss is a 100% loss and each gain is a 100% gain within a pixel. We then rescaled the net loss to a 26-year period (two generations; Pacifici et al. 2013). The result is a conservatively estimated ~15% net loss in forest cover over two generations.Although Pygmy Hippos are not generally a primary target for subsistence hunting, they are reported to be taken opportunistically by bushmeat hunters. There are also reports from some locations of Pygmy Hippos being by commercial hunters (e.g. Dufour 2002). They are killed predominantly for their meat and, unlike the Common Hippo, their teeth have little trade value, but many of their body parts, including the skull, may be used in rituals or traditional medicine (Robinson 1970, Hentschel 1990).Whilst Pygmy Hippos are legally protected in all range countries, the level of enforcement is limited due to a lack of capacity in terms of human and financial resources and adequate training.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

Development  for agriculture and logging would remove key foraging areas and result  in potential isolation of the cave roosts, causing declines of these  principal populations. Similar declines have already been observed in  other nearby islands. Above several caves roosted by this species  (110-196 newborn young and 900-1,730 individuals during maternity and  hibernation periods, respectively) on the Ishigaki Island, new airport  has been constructed in 2013. After construction, number of roosting  individuals in these caves have not been significantly declined in  maternity season (100-200 newborn young), but have been declined in  Autumn and hibernation period (about 350 individuals) (Kara Karst  Scientific Committee 2014, New Ishigaki Airport Bat Monitoring Committee  2015). There has been similar pressure on Ishigaki Island to build a  holiday resort. Publicity about the plight of these bats resulted in  increased public interest, including increased tourism to the breeding  caves.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Humans are consistently indicated as the major source of mortality throughout the evaluated range, largely because the hyaena is loathed as a grave robber, is associated with several superstitions (e.g. in the Middle East), and because of incidents of damage to agriculture (e.g. in Israel) and livestock (Abi-Said 2006, Bunaian et al. 2001, Hofer 1998, Al Younis 1993, Wagner 2013). Striped Hyaenas are very susceptible to accidental or targeted poisoning as they readily accept strychnine-poisoned bait. For example, along the Mediterranean coast in Israel, the Striped Hyaena was exterminated by strychnine poisoning during the rabies eradication campaign administered by the British government between 1918 and 1948. The Striped Hyaenas ate poisoned donkey carcasses that were provided to control Golden Jackals, then the main carrier of rabies. Further large-scale poisoning occurred between 1950 and 1970 (Hofer 1998). In Jordan, Lebanon, and the Palmyra area in Syria, the species is heavily persecuted (including destruction or blockage of dens, poisoning carcasses, or the use of the fire to chase animals out of dens) (Abi-Said 2006, Qarqaz et al. 2004). There is also illegal trade in skins, and body parts for use in traditional medicine (as there is elsewhere in the range), and they are often kept in cages for display purposes (G. Serra pers. comm. 2014). The species is commercially hunted in Morocco for use in traditional medicine, with various parts being used (especially the brain) and may fetch very high prices. Hunters may travel hundreds of kilometres to capture this species (F. Cuzin pers. comm. 2007).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Brown Hyaena body parts are used in traditional medicine and Brown Hyaenas are also often unintentional victims of lethal problem animal  control through poisons and poaching through snares (I. Wiesel, C. Edwards, L. Boast and R. Yarnell pers. comms. 2014). Lethal control remains the most predominant form of conflict resolution. The Brown Hyaena is regarded as a threat to livestock in some areas, and over 72% of livestock owners in Namibia believe that the Brown Hyaena is responsible for losses (Lindsey et al. 2013), despite the finding that Brown Hyaenas very seldom prey on livestock (Maude and Mills 2005). In South Africa's North West Province 40% of livestock owners regard the Brown Hyaena as a problem animal (Thorn 2008), but in the North West Province, only 6% of surveyed farmers admit to having killed Brown Hyaenas on their property (St John et al. 2011).

The species is valued for its meat, and for the semi-digested milk found in the rumen of unweaned fawns, which is used in traditional medicine as a cure against indigestion in children (Won and Smith 1999). It is sometimes trapped as a pest in China, and is reported to be a low-concern pest of rice fields in DPR Korea (J.W. Duckworth in litt. 2008). Hunting is carried out at night with dogs (Sun Lixing pers. comm. 1990). Most hunting in DPR Korea is probably with snares; guns are highly restricted and active hunting with dogs, although doubtless occurring to some extent, is too publicly visible to be the preferred choice. Snares for deer are at very high density in forest hill areas; no assessment has been made of their usage in the lower Chongchon plain where Water Deer remain common. It is not therefore possible to speculate on the species' resilience to such hunting (J.W. Duckworth in litt. 2008).In Yancheng Nature Reserve, poaching is reported as severe, and there is high mortality during periods of flooding. Fawns have been bought from local people to establish and support the captive population, where the mortality rate is reportedly high (Zhang 1994). Water Deer have evidently been reduced or extirpated in most of the reserve, remaining only in the relatively small core area (Xu et al. 1998, Zhu et al. 2004).Habitat loss through reclamation for agriculture and urban development is a major threat to Water Deer in eastern China (Xu et al. 1998). Formerly widespread areas of appropriate habitat north of the Yangtze River delta have been lost and the remaining areas fragmented, leaving remaining subpopulations of Water Deer vulnerable. The Korean subpopulations, at least in DPR Korea, are highly threatened by habitat loss, on the assumption that wild population will not persist in fully agricultural landscapes. It is reported, however, to be ""moderately widespread"" at least in the Republic of Korea. In DPR Korea, agricultural policies have led to a large-scale land rezoning programme which involves the canalisation of streams, removal of damp hollows and generally the conversion to active farmland of all areas within the plains which have retained semi-natural vegetation to date. This programme is ongoing. Coastal habitats have so far fared better but there are ambitious plans for the reclamation of large proportions of the intertidal areas on the west coast, and this will involve major loss of the currently extensive suitable habitat present in natural coastal plains. With no empirical information on the use of purely agricultural regions by Water Deer in Korea, the precise effects of these ongoing and planned habitat changes are unclear; field study is required. Ground-dwelling mammals in DPR Korea are under heavy snaring pressure, at least in forest areas. The extent of snaring in the non-forest habitats occupied by this species and the effects of snaring on local populations are unclear. The situation in the lower Chongchon plain, an area with high human population densities and heavy conversion of plains land to agriculture (although retaining a largely natural coastal zone and channel profile for the river itself) suggest that either snaring levels are not so high in these areas or Water Deer are resilient to them (J.W. Duckworth in litt. 2008).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

Wetlands harbour comparatively high rodent densities compared with other habitat types, and form the core areas of Serval home ranges. Of secondary importance is degradation of grasslands through annual burning followed by over-grazing by domestic livestock, leading to reduced abundance of small mammals (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Ray et al. 2005).International legal commercial trade is generally declining (Nowell and Jackson 1996), although skins are still traded in large quantities in some countries, such as Senegal, Gambia and Benin (Burnham and Di Silvestre in Hunter and Bowland 2013), and exported to North Africa (K. de Smet and F. Cuzin pers. comm. 2007). Serval pelts seen in trade in Morocco could come from elsewhere, or could indicate the species continued existence in that country (Arce and Prunier 2006). In Zambia pelts are rarely used for traditional clothing, often it is used as substitute for Leopard skins (C. Thiel pers. comm.) Trade in West Africa appears to be primarily for ceremonial or medicinal purposes. For example, they are highly valued for traditional medicine in Nigeria, where, among markets surveyed in five south-west Nigerian towns in 1994, Servals were the second most commonly offered mammalian species (Sodeinde and Soewu 1999 in Hunter and Bowland 2013). Gadsby (1991) proved the occurrence of Serval in Nigeria based on furs of this species being commonly traded on local markets. Trade evidence is used by Maisels et al. (2001) for occurrence in Cameroon and by Sayer and Green (1984) for occurrence in Benin.Although Serval very rarely prey upon livestock (and indeed may even be beneficial to crop farmers due to their predilection for rodents), in rural areas throughout Africa, they are sometimes persecuted for taking poultry and indiscriminate predator control methods practised by pastoralists frequently kill them (L. Hunter and J. Bowland pers. comms.).Sometimes other predators, such as leopards, hyaenas or lions, kill young and even adult Serval (Thiel 2011).",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0

Other threats may include negative effects of ingestion of pesticides applied to plants, competition for roosts and nectar, natural catastrophes, disease and predation; however, these are not believed to be major limiting factors, though some of them could become significant for subpopulations reduced to small size by other factors (see USFWS 2000). These bats are sensitive to disturbance in their roosting sites (they often quickly take flight upon human entry; Wilson 1985) and, in general, roosting caves are becoming increasingly subject to human destruction and disturbance. Human disturbance and destruction of roost sites is a common occurrence in Mexico. The availability of roost sites free from disturbance may be a significant limiting factor. Special precautions should be taken when mine and cave surveys are conducted. In June and July when the young are very small, disturbance can cause them to lose their grasp on the rock and fall to their death. During hibernation, disturbance will cause an increase in metabolism; this use of fat reserves may cause starvation prior to spring (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 1996). A major problem for bats all over Mexico is that uninformed citizens frequently destroy all bats in a roost, believing them to be vampire bats. Foraging habitat can be degraded or destroyed by harvesting of agave (an important food resource). Although it has been estimated that bootleg mescal makers are eliminating between 500,00 and 1,200,000 wild paniculate agave a year in Sonora alone, there is no clear support for such a statement. Agave plant parts are harvested just before they bloom; this prevents flowering and can prevent reproduction by the affected plant (an agave plant grows for 10 to 20 years, flowers only once, then dies). However, there are few places in Sonora or elsewhere in Mexico where wild Agave harvesting has eliminated a significant percentage of nectar-producing genets, and plants harvested by indigenous people generally produce vegetative offshoots that may eventually produce flowers (Nabhan and Fleming 1993). Populations of unharvested plants persist in many areas that are not easily accessible to humans. The negative impact of agave harvest probably is not as great as was previously believed. On the other hand, reduced pollination resulting from decreased bat populations may eventually lead to a reduction in agave distribution and abundance. Some foraging habitat has been degraded or destroyed by expansion of agriculture and other land uses. Large areas of both the Sierra Madre Oriental and Sierra Madre Occidental and the Mexican Plateau have been converted to agriculture or rangeland. This species may experience predation from owls, hawks, snakes and mammals, but natural levels of predation likely are inconsequential to the overall status of the species. However, increased populations of domestic and feral cats and other predators near human habitations may affect the survival of colonies, particularly maternity colonies (USFWS 2000).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Poaching also occurs in some areas by military personnel, road maintenance workers, and others, especially in areas accessible by vehicle (Schaller et al., 1987). Additional threats to ibex include competition with livestock for food and habitat, and in some areas by predators. As a result of these threats, some populations have declined significantly, especially in regions with dense human populations. In 2007, producers of wool products in Nepal began marketing a product they termed “yangir”, which they claimed originated from wild, hunted Capra sibirica. (Some hair fibers from C. sibirica are quite fine, and may potentially be used for high-quality wool). At least one importer based in Germany was marketing these products as high-end, speciality scarves. As of this writing, the origin of these products (and whether they indeed came from C. sibirica) had not yet been determined. Trophy hunting programs in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Pakistan produce only a few animals/year, and are unlikely to be the source of a commercially-marketed wool product. If Capra sibirica were being poached specifically to feed this market, formerly stable populations could quickly become threatened. In Afghanistan, prior to the wars, Siberian ibex was abundant and hunted throughout its range by local tribesmen. The impact of hunting was believed to be limited. Hunting is also the major threat to the species, especially where new roads increase accessibility and modern weapons improve efficiency for hunters. In China, poaching is a minor threat; guns have mostly been confiscated from pastoralists living near ibex habitat, although some poaching by police and/or military no doubt continues. Competition with livestock may occur.In India, increased grazing and disturbance from livestock are apparent in some areas (Fox et al., 1986, 1994; Pandey, 1993), whereas in others these activities may be decreasing (Fox et al., unpubl. data). The rugged habitats used by ibex will probably insulate them from excessive competition by livestock (although see Bagchi et al.  2004 for an alternative perspective) so that hunting will remain the primary human influence on populations throughout their range. Possible hybridization of ibex with domestic goats as reported in the Spiti valley (Johnsingh, unpubl. data) needs to be verified and monitored. In Pakistan, competition for food with livestock is a growing threat to Asiatic ibex. In Mongolia, the major threats to the species include grazing competition and disturbance from livestock, and poaching (Mallon et al. 1997, Clark et al. 2006). Ibex is probably less affected than argali by poaching and competition with livestock, because of the more precipitous and hence less accessible terrain it occupies, yet both probably negatively impact the species (Mallon et al. 1997,  Clark et al. 2006). Illegal and unsustainable hunting for meat, trophies and skins remains a threat (Wingard and Zahler 2006), although habitat degradation through grazing by increasing livestock numbers and competition for pasture and water may constitute threats in some areas (Reading et al. 2006b) and increasing resource extraction and mining activities may also result in habitat loss and degradation.

The primary threat in the southeastern United States is probably habitat loss. Human modification of Coastal Plain habitats, including forestry practices that favour pine monocultures, fire suppression, and development (golf courses, residential, etc.), probably are putting increasing pressure on remaining populations. The requirement for mature lowland hardwoods in the rapidly developing Southeast puts the species at particular risk. Removal of abandoned buildings and barns might also be harmful by removing potential nesting places. While the species is probably secure over most of its range, several subspecies of eastern woodrat have undergone declines in recent years. The main threat in North Carolina appears to be habitat loss. The population on Bald Head Island, Brunswick County, was extirpated in 1966, and the Scotts Hill population was destroyed by 1987 when the area was converted to a pine plantation. While the woodrat persists at Rocky Point, much of the lowland forest habitat there was destroyed by the construction of Interstate 40. Predation is a threat for all herbivore species. Feral cats can be a serious threat in developed areas. Woodrats have been shown to suffer from many ecto- and endoparasites and, while the effects of these parasites on Neotoma populations remains unknown, Alan (1987) suggested that at least one population in Florida may have been extirpated by an outbreak of ticks. Neal (1967; cited in Alan 1987) suggested that fluctuations in woodrat populations in the Mississippi River Basin may be linked to abundances in acorn crops, and other authors have linked fluctuations to extreme weather conditions (Nawrot and Klimstra 1976). Hall (1988) pointed out a correlation between gypsy moth spread and woodrat declines in Pennsylvania, suggesting that depressed acorn production may impact woodrat over-winter survival (see Norris 1992).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

In Myanmar muntjacs including presumed Gongshan Muntjacs are hunted (non-specifically within general ungulate hunting) for meat, but also for skins which are used widely for clothing. In Hkakaborazi National Park, some hunting is by the relatively small number of permanent inhabitants of the park, who trade wildlife and plant products for basic livelihood support, such as salt. More serious are organised non-local heavily armed parties of professional poachers who enter the protected area for months at a time and hunt intensively to supply the wildlife trade. The numbers of such groups per year seem to be increasing. Hunting patterns in other areas supporting the species are not well known, but it is likely that anywhere in this region with a large population of ungulates remaining attracts heavy hunting from outsiders (Rabinowitz et al. 1998, Rabinowitz and Saw Tun Khaing 1998, Than Zaw pers. comm. 2006, J. W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). Heavy hunting pressure from hill tribes was reported from Yunnan Province (R. Wirth pers. comm. 1990), and although there are no current data available from China, hunting is thought to remain a major threat there. The Chinese population has been considered rare and small, and threatened by hunting (Wang 1998), but this assumes a far more limited distribution than is likely. Much of the Myanmar range is within an area which has seen remarkable stability of forest cover (Renner et al. 2007). However, this healthy situation may change in the near future, as some other forests of northern Kachin state (which have not been surveyed for the species, and so may hold, or have held, it) have recently been devastated (Eames 2007). Although habitat needs, and thus the effects of forest fragmentation and degradation are essentially unknown, it is unlikely that viable populations can survive outright forest conversion. It is also likely that in areas where forest is being fragmented, negative effects of hunting on populations of this muntjac are compounded and so populations decline, whatever intrinsic ability the species has to use fragmented areas. Protected area coverage, and retention of little-encroached habitat, is also relatively good in the Gaoligongshan of China at high altitudes (Lan and Dunbar 2000).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

Deforestation and associated reduction/elimination of food resources currently may be a threat to some local woodrat populations. Causes of the continuing decline are not yet fully understood, but some hypotheses have been offered. Probably the explanation lies in a combination of these and other factors that may differ locally in importance (Linzey 1990).Parasitism by the raccoon roundworm (Baylisascaris procyonis) has been identified as a significant cause of mortality and a probable major factor in the decline in several states (McGowan 1993; Hicks pers. comm., 1994; Johnson et al. 1997; LoGiudice 2000). Although rarely fatal to raccoons, infestation may cause cerebrospinal nematodiasis in other species and has caused declines in some populations (Kazacos 1983). New York released and monitored woodrats in formerly occupied areas and all the animals died (50 total, including the released adults and their progeny); 11 of the 13 recovered carcasses were infected by the roundworms (McGowan 1993; Hicks pers. comm., 1994). Stone observed that woodrat decline in New York coincided with a marked increase in raccoon numbers (Linzey 1990). Hayes (unpublished research proposal) suggested that woodrats may be especially vulnerable for two reasons: 1) among other novel items, woodrats are known to carry back to their nests the faeces of other animals, which might include raccoon scats contaminated with B. procyonis eggs, and 2) a ""relatively long generation time increases the probability that individuals will become infested prior to reproduction."" Both of these reasons recently have been documented (McGowan pers. comm., 1994). Additionally, McGowan (pers. comm., 1994) found that woodrats may colonize areas where an infected woodrat has recently died, thus perhaps maintaining spread of the parasite. Hall (1988) noticed a correlation between the spread of the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) and loss of woodrats in Pennsylvania. ""There is a possibility that acorns make up a significant part of the food supply of the species in Pennsylvania. Acorns may be important as a winter food source since they can be stored for long periods of time. Studies conducted by the Pennsylvania Game Commission show that acorn production drops to zero for several years following defoliation. Gypsy moth infestation has resulted in considerable mortality of oaks, especially along the poorer soils of rocky ridge tops. These are the areas where many rocky sites are found, which are ideal woodrat habitats."" In support of his argument, Hall noted that at three other sites where woodrats survived, other winter food sources were available. In a similar theory, McGowan (pers. comm., 1994) speculated that the 1930-1940s permanent loss of the American chestnut (Castanea dentata) may be a factor. This chestnut was extremely hardy and a bountiful producer of mast, and its previous distribution essentially mirrors the historic distribution of the woodrat. Loss of this stable and predictable food source may have led to the continuing woodrat population decline.Nawrot and Klimstra (1976) argued that the disappearance of a similar species, N. floridiana illinoensis, was likely due to two unusually severe winters. ""Despite a tolerance of Neotoma to many environmental conditions, severe winter weather appears to be a major factor in sudden woodrat population declines. Fitch and Rainy (1956) recorded a drastic decline in Neotoma floridianaabundance in Kansas after two winters of below-average temperatures and prolonged snow and ice cover. Significantly, this decimated population was unable to make substantial gains and continued to decline gradually for several years."" Weather also has been proposed as a factor in Neotoma magister decline, a view that is supported by the fact that the decline has been in the northern part of the range. Records in Pennsylvania and West Virginia over the past thirty years indicate ""below normal"" temperatures in critical months accompanying the observed shrinkage in range (Linzey pers. comm., 1994).In some areas, including caves popular with spelunkers, human disturbance has been implicated in the disappearance of woodrat populations (e.g., Kirkland 1986). These woodrats do seem to avoid areas of human habitation or heavy human use, but many sites where they have disappeared are remote and rarely visited by people. Habitat is generally inaccessible and undesirable for development, but strip mining of coal and limestone is a potential threat in many areas. Monty and Feldhamer (2002) stated that increased predation by great horned owls has been proposed as a threat, but owl predation seems highly unlikely as a reason for the decline. Populations often are small and isolated, hence highly susceptible to extirpation (Mengak pers. comm., 1994).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In South Africa, the Aardwolf was previously persecuted by some farmers for the mistaken belief that it was a predator on livestock, chickens and eggs (Richardson 1984, Anderson 1988). However, such reports are not substantiated by studies of gut or faecal contents and probably result from mistaken identity with hyaenas or jackals (Anderson 2013). Fortunately, this perception has now changed and most farmers actively conserve Aardwolves. They are, however, the occasional inadvertent victims of problem animal control operations, especially those using gin traps (M.D. Anderson pers. obs. 2014).Loss of habitat, through urbanization and agricultural expansion, may be having an important negative impact. For example, some farmers in South Africa destroy termitaria, using a plough or poisons, and these areas then become unsuitable for Aardwolves. Poisons used for locust control may also have an adverse effect on Aardwolves (Anderson 2013). Additional mortality factors include predation by other carnivores, and accidental road casualties as Aardwolves fail to move out of the way of oncoming vehicles at night (Anderson 2013).",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Buffalo are favoured target of meat hunters in many countries, and poaching has been a major contributor to the recent decline of many buffalo populations, including in some national parks. War and civil unrest especially in Central Africa over the last 30 years has had – and continues to have – a negative effect. Buffalo are susceptible to drought, which has caused substantial declines in some populations in the Sahel at the end of the 1960s and during the 1990s in Tsavo, Serengeti/Mara, Gonarezhou and Kruger also strongly impacted buffalo populations (East 1999, Cornélis et al. 2014).African Buffalo are susceptible to a range of indigenous and imported infectious diseases. In the past, numbers of African Buffalo suffered their most severe collapse during the great rinderpest epidemic of the 1890s, which, coupled with pleuro-pneumonia, caused mortalities as high as 95% among livestock and wild ungulates (Winterbach 1998). Rinderpest was declared eradicated in Africa in 2011 (Morens et al. 2011).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Pocket gophers may not persist in residential areas due to persecution by trapping, poisoning, and predation by cats and dogs. Gravel mining affects gopher habitat on some private lands. Most occupied habitat on public lands is affected by non conservation uses including military training and recreation. Gopher populations at airports can be affected by the development of airport-related facilities and businesses, and the management of airport grassland. The small size and isolation of most remaining populations of Mazama pocket gopher put them at risk of local extinction, and without increased protection, all but T. m. melanops in Olympic National Park could go extinct. Historically, local gopher populations probably exchanged genetic material by individuals occasionally dispersing through intervening oak woodlands and forest; prairie patches where gophers went extinct would eventually be recolonized. Today, these prairie patches are increasingly surrounded by roads and suburbs that are inhospitable to dispersing gophers.

The conversion of native grassland prairies has been implicated as one of the most important factors for the contraction of the Swift Fox range (Hillman and Sharps 1978). Alteration of the landscape likely influences local and seasonal prey availability, increases risk of predation on Swift Foxes, and leads to interspecific competition with other predators such as the Coyote and Red Fox (Moehrenschlager et al. 2007, Thompson and Gese 2007). Moreover, an increasing trend towards irrigation of crops from the dry-land farming practices of fallow cropland every other year could exclude Swift Foxes that have adapted to den and forage successfully under the dryland farming rotational practices. The planting of tall, dense vegetation as a part of the United States Conservation Reserve Program may also negatively impact Swift Foxes, because they avoid these densely vegetated habitats.

Estimates from surveys at bushmeat markets on the Liberia-Côte d’Ivoire border and around Sapo National Park in southeastern Liberia reveal that primates – including P. b. badius – are being hunted at rates that are almost certainly unsustainable (Covey and McGraw 2014, Greengrass 2016). In Côte d’Ivoire, where hunting is especially intensive, this monkey is reported to have disappeared from all areas except Taï National Park, and possibly the Cavally Classified Forest to the north of Taï National Park (Sanderson et al. 2015) and in relic forest in the Tonkpi region, near Côte d’Ivoire’s border with Guinea and Liberia (Kramoko et al. 2017).It is estimated that in Guinea-Bissau almost 200 red colobus are hunted during each dry season to supply the two urban bushmeat markets and the meat is consumed in dedicated bushmeat restaurants (Minhós et al. 2013). In Guinea, the intensity of hunting has increased since 2000, with bushmeat also coming from Niokolo Koba in Senegal to supply the city of Conakry and large towns (Galat-Luong and Galat pers. obs. 1983–2000). In addition, skins are used in animistic practices and traded in dedicated markets (Sá et al. 2012).Offtake levels are likely increasing due to increased hunting associated with significant human population growth and habitat degradation. Hunting has increased due to heightened demand for bushmeat, increasingly fragmented and smaller forest blocks, and improved access to forest interiors through logging (Laurance et al. 2015, Sloan et al. 2016). Indeed, the human population has increased by more than 100% in the seven range countries since 1990 (Worldometer 2020).Deforestation through logging, charcoal production, mining and clearance for agricultural land, including industrial-scale plantations, has occurred over much of the species range (McGraw 1998, Bitty et al. 2015, WCF 2015).In the P. b. badius subspecies’ range, analysis of satellite imagery of tree cover shows that Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea were among the 10 countries with the fastest annual rate of forest loss in the world in the 2001–2014 period (Petersen et al. 2015). According to Global Forest Watch, Côte d’Ivoire lost about 17% of its forest cover between 2000 and 2015 with an annual deforestation rate of 2.69% – among the highest in the world. Many areas in Côte d’Ivoire designated as protected areas no longer contain forest and have been largely or completely converted to plantations (Gonedelé Bi et al. 2012, Bitty et al. 2015). A list of countries with the largest increase in primary forest loss during 2018 includes two P. badius badius host countries in the top 10: Côte d’Ivoire was ranked second (26% increase) and Liberia (12% increase) was ranked sixth. When the world’s countries are ranked by the amount of primary forest lost as a percentage of the country’s total, Côte d’Ivoire is second (1.88%) and Sierra Leone is sixth (1.23%) (all forest loss data GFW 2019).In the P. b. temminckii subspecies’ range, 16.2% (>15,000 km²) of forest habitat has been lost in the past 17 years (2001–2018, GFW 2019; 1.7 generations for this taxon). Total forest lost during this period varied between 9.2% in Senegal and 16.6% in Guinea. With the exception of Gambia, rates of forest loss have more than doubled since 2013 in all range countries (GFW 2019). However, forest loss would have been occurring continuously long before 2001; extrapolating the lowest estimate of forest loss (9.2%) to the decade 1990–2000, gives an estimated total of 22% of suitable habitat lost over three generations.Degradation and loss of natural habitat also lead to increasing human-wildlife-human conflict (e.g., Starin 1989; Struhsaker 2005, 2010; Galat et al. 2009). Furthermore, large areas in the range of P. badius were impacted by civil conflict between 1989 and 2011, and this negatively impacted Western Red Colobus populations in Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia, Senegal and Sierra Leone.For additional information on threats, see the two Piliocolobus badius subspecies assessments.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

They are hunted in the southern United States (Whitaker  and Hamilton 1998). Over the last twenty years, Marsh Rabbits have  essentially disappeared in the southern part of Everglades National Park  (Dorcas et al. 2012), a pattern that is best explained by predation from invasive Burmese Pythons (Python molurus vivittatus) (Sovie et al. 2016).The  Lower Keys subspecies was listed as endangered by the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service in 1990. The primary reason cited for listing the  species was the loss and fragmentation of its habitat due to human  development. From 1959 to 2006, 47% of the Lower Keys Marsh Rabbit's  habitat was lost to sea level rise and another 8% was lost to human  development. Human development has also resulted in increased isolation  for some patches, reducing the likelihood of recolonization. Although  the rate of habitat loss has slowed since the rabbit received legal  protection, habitat destruction and fragmentation remain significant  threats to the species' persistence (Faulhaber 2003). LaFever et al.  (2007) modelled the potential impact resulting from oceanic rise, due  to thermal expansion only, on Marsh Rabbit habitat. They found that the  three most important factors impacting potential change were: the rate  at which sea-level rise impacts the ability of flora migration upslope,  the magnitude in terms of the overall oceanic rise and whether it is  great enough to reach Marsh Rabbit habitat, and whether or not humans  abandon low-lying habitat, where abandonment would facilitate greater  ease of upslope migration by vegetation. They recommended multiple  management strategies for the local ecosystem: consideration of land-use  planning, use of bioclimatic reserve systems in conjunction with  corridors (LaFever et al. 2007). More recent vulnerability assessments (Reece et al.  2013) concluded the Lower Keys Marsh Rabbit to be highly likely of  extinction by 2100 due to sea level rise, lack of freshwater, and  barriers to dispersal.Additional threats to the subspecies  include mortality from pythons, cars, and cats (both domestic and  feral). Cars and cats accounted for more than half of the mortalities  observed by E.A. Forys on Boca Chica in the early 1990s (Forys 1993).  Faulhaber (2003) estimated that just over half of occupied local  populations are reasonably likely to have current or future impacts due  to cats. A recent population viability analysis supports this assertion,  indicating that without predator control, habitat improvement efforts  may result in a negligible increase in the chance for persistence  (LaFever 2006). The subspecies is also threatened by habitat degradation  from invasive exotic plants, trash dumping, mowing and off-road vehicle  use (Forys 1993). If left unchecked, invasive exotic vegetation can  render patches unsuitable for rabbits. Management efforts have reduced  the threat of invasive exotic vegetation on some government-owned  properties, but invasive exotic vegetation remains a problem on  privately-owned land parcels and even on some government properties.  Currently, trash dumping and off-road vehicle use appear to be less of a  problem than in the past (Forys 1993, Faulhaber 2003).It has  been suggested that Red Imported Fire Ants (Solenopsis invicta) (Forys  1993) and elevated Raccoon (Procyon lotor) densities also pose a threat  to the subspecies (Schmidt et al. 2010). Historically, poaching  may have contributed to the rabbit's decline, but poaching does not  appear to be a major threat at the current time. Feral hogs degraded  habitat and may have caused the extirpation of rabbits on Little Pine  Key, but hogs were removed from the islands in the 1990s (Wilmers 2003).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Similarly there is no evidence that it is hunted (as targeted quarry or as by-catch) in any land-mass at levels high enough to drive declines within remaining suitable habitat. Therefore, forest loss rates are likely to provide a reasonable indicator of population decline rates.In Borneo the species is geographically and altitudinally widespread, and evidently occurs frequently in degraded and fragmented habitats (Duckworth et al. in prep.). While large-scale deforestation of Borneo in recent decades will have driven large declines in the Bornean population, there is no evidence of major threats within remaining suitable habitat. Some level of retributory killing as a (perceived or actual) predator of small livestock is likely.In the Malay peninsula, the restriction to altitudes below 160 m and to native forest means that huge declines will have occurred in the latter half of the twentieth century, with the large-scale conversion of lowland forest to plantations. Rates of conversion have recently dropped considerably (because little remains to be converted outside legally protected areas), but the suitability of the present landscape to peninsular Short-tailed Mongoose is difficult to evaluate. There is no meaningful information on patch size required for viable populations, or on dispersal through habitats that cannot maintain the species. Although it is not known to be, it is quite plausible that the peninsular population is in ongoing decline and would warrant conservation attention.The level of threat on Sumatra is unclear. Lowland forest loss on Sumatra is proceeding extremely rapidly, and if the species is tied to lowland forest there, major declines will be ongoing. However, if it has an altitudinal distribution similar to that in Borneo and if it uses anthropogenic habitats, declines in Sumatra will be much shallower. While an exhaustive presentation of Sumatran records with altitude and habitat condition remains to be conducted, those few records with precise altitude traced for this assessment were all from the lowlands and, because the species is evidently localized on the island, even in old-growth forest, it is possible that current rates and patterns of forest loss on Sumatra are causing serious reductions on the island.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Indeed, they are often associated and all the island’s ungulates suffer from the increased hunting that often accompanies logging (Bennett and Dahaban 1995, Bennett and Gumal 2001), such that hunting to local extinction is the chief detrimental effect of logging on ungulates in Sarawak (Bennett and Gumal 2001). Hunting is for meat, medicine and hides.The extent to which habitat encroachment and hunting constitute threats specifically to M. atherodes is unclear, reflecting a paucity of studies to determine its resilience. Logging has been reported to lead to slight decreases in densities of the species, and this seems to be due to habitat change per se rather than elevated hunting (which usually accompanies logging; Bennett and Gumal 2001) because M. muntjak in the same study was found to increase strongly after logging (Heydon 1994). In the Sarawak Planted Forests, Bintulu Division, Sarawak, muntjacs (probably mostly this species) are among the commonest species camera-trapped in young Acacia mangium plantations (under four years old) and have been seen browsing on young acacia shoots. Footprints are common in the adjacent newly planted areas and forest fragments (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008). However, this area contains a substantial proportion of natural, if somewhat degraded, forest, which in theory might be found to be necessary for populations in the highly altered habitats. Information on the species in landscape-scale plantations has not been traced. In terms of coping with fragmentation, M. atherodes has survived at least for several years in several forest isolates of 100 km² or less, Similajau National Park (Sarawak; J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. based on observations in 2005), Sepilok Forest Reserve (only 42 km²; muntjacs not confirmed as this species; Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008), and Sungai Wain (Kalimantan; G.M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008); in the latter, where there is little hunting except around the margins, it is common. But the current carving up of the formerly extensive forest of lowland Borneo is so recent that determining long-term persistence in such fragments is impossible; doomed populations in slow but fixed decline may account for records in fragmented and degraded areas. There is no good evidence that any muntjac is tied to old-growth forest, however, even in areas where two or more species are sympatric (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008).Muntjacs are widely and heavily hunted on Borneo for meat, skins, and as a source of traditional remedies (Bennett et al. 2000; Mohd Azlan J. pers. comm. 2008; Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008; G. M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008; A. C. Sebastian pers. comm. 2008; Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008). Traditionally, hunting used traps, dogs and spears, and blowpipes. Hunters in remote parts of the interior still use these methods, but most animals now die by gunfire. Sarawak held 60,000 legally registered shotguns while Sabah held almost 13,000 in the mid 1990s (Bennett et al. 2000). Methods used in Indonesia include guns and spotlights along logging roads, snaring, and dogs (G. M. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2008). The combination of dogs and guns may be particularly efficient (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008). Snaring is still very heavy for the region (although bears no comparison to the extremely intensive snaring levels found for instance in Vietnam, outside well-secured areas, but at least in some areas seems not to catch many of this species: Belden Giman (pers. comm. 2008) found during interviews with 75 longhouses inside the Sarawak Planted Forests (Bintulu) that the highest percentage (73% and 12%) of game species caught by snares were pigs and porcupines respectively; muntjacs (both species) totalled less than 2% of animals, even though in this area they are common. Shotguns remain the even bigger problem (Bennett et al. 2000; Mohd Azlan J. pers. comm. 2008; Siew Te Wong pers. comm. 2008). Unaccompanied packs of stray or even perhaps feral dogs are also likely to be a threat, particularly in forest isolates close to urban areas (e.g. Similajau National Park; J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). It is unlikely that hunters make any distinction between the two Bornean muntjac species directly, although it is plausible that M. atherodes is under higher hunting pressure than is M. muntjak reflecting its purported predominance in the lowlands, where most of the logging concessions currently lie. Plantation estates are also concentrated in the lowlands, but Bennett et al. (2000) found that hunting levels in them were low, not least because they supported so few animals that would-be hunters preferred to journey to forest areas. Even when these were nearby, few labourers were hunting, because of the demands of their job, and, crucially, the disincentives by plantations companies for them to own shotguns. As non-locals with limited financial security, most followed employer rules preventing ownership of guns. Experience elsewhere shows that in such situations, local hunters may see such concentrations of labourers as potential markets, therefore leading to an increase in hunting even though it is not undertaken directly by the labourers. As plantations cover ever more Bornean lowlands, this may become a more significant stimulant of hunting. Also, although some ethnic groups, at least the Punan, have traditional beliefs against eating muntjac meat (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008), over most of (at least) Malaysian Borneo, “in general, everyone will hunt and eat anything” (Bennett et al. 2000). Much hunting is for the market rather than local use, so there is a limitless demand. Bennett and Gumal (2001) profiled the hunting of ungulates in Sarawak in the mid 1990s thus: muntjacs (along with Bearded Pig Sus barbatus and Sambar Rusa unicolor) are heavily shot for wild meat trade across Sarawak, and these ungulates are the species most sought by the restaurants. Wild meat is widely sold in towns, villages, restaurants and logging camps throughout Sarawak; 250 sales outlets were estimated across the state in 1996, with an annual trade worth 3.75 million USD. Along the Rejang river alone, in the mid 1980s, 250 muntjacs were sold per year (Caldecott 1988). The market for meat is great and in the 1990s was probably expanding. There were, then, no controls on commercial hunting of non-protected species (including muntjacs). The implementation of the Master Plan for Wildlife in Sarawak (Wildlife Conservation Society and Sarawak Forest Department 1996) introduced a strict ban on all wildlife trade, shotgun ownership and cartridge sales in the late 1990s (Bennett and Gumal 2001). Substantial numbers of muntjacs are, nevertheless, still killed in the state, as they are elsewhere in Borneo.Bennett et al. (2000) considered the effects of this onslaught upon muntjacs (not distinguished to species) through a lengthy hunting study in February 1993 to June 1995, in both Bornean states of Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah), each with eight study areas. Muntjacs constituted only 4–11% of animals killed, but index counts of signs show an inverse relationship between sign index and hunting pressure so strong that the latter over-rode the effects of habitat variables in determining their densities. Hunting was so ubiquitous, even in protected areas, that in the two states, only one site (part of Danum Valley, Sabah) could be found as a control, where there was primary forest but negligible hunting levels. They concluded that “the only single factor offering any effective protection for [quarry species of] wildlife is difficulty of access”; whether animals are protected or non-protected species, inside or outside protected areas, had no significant restraint on hunting levels. Since that study, much forest has been converted and muntjac populations in the smaller and more isolated areas that remain must now be more vulnerable to local extinctions.Against this backdrop of evidence for widespread hunting of muntjacs, the M. atherodes population in Sarawak Planted Forests, Bintulu Division appears to have been stable between 2008 and 2014 despite some ongoing illegal hunting; in this area pigs Sus and Sambar Rusa unicolor appear to be the primary quarry (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2014).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The number, and, particularly, the locations relative to human activity of various recent records, notably from China (Lau et al. 2010, Bosco P.L. Chan pers. comm. 2014) and Lao PDR (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2014) strongly indicate that the former qualitative assessments of threat levels were inaccurate. In both China and Lao PDR there are records from landscapes where hunting has been sufficiently intensive to have removed most of the mammals of similar size and larger. Moreover, detection rates are not noticeably different in areas otherwise broadly comparable that have significant control of hunting (e.g. Nam Et-Phou Louey National Protected Area, Lao PDR) (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). The survival of this species in heavily hunted areas may in part reflect its natural history, but it appears to be genuinely resilient given the number of records of animals from snare-lines and other hunting sources (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2014). There has been an increased demand for small carnivore meat in Chinese and Viet Namese markets (Bell et al. 2004), but this species does not seem to be specifically sought in the trade: extensive examination of trade seizures through Viet Nam (the main route to China) hardly ever found the species (U. Streicher pers. comm. 2009), nor is it sought in trade within China (M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2006). Nor is it preferentially sought at the local, subsistence level, although throughout its range when it is caught it is likely to be eaten. The low price at which individuals are sold in markets (see 'Use and trade') further indicates low demand relative to supply. The highly degraded and fragmented nature of the habitat in some Lao localities suggests that ongoing forest encroachment may have relatively little effect on this species except where it results in landscape-level conversion to non-forest use. This is proceeding rapidly over large parts of the species range, but is concentrated in level lowlands, not the rugged terrain which probably, now, supports most Spotted Linsangs.The concern expressed in the IUCN Action Plan for the Conservation of Mustelids and Viverrids (Schreiber et al. 1989), was made at a time when most of its geographic range was out of access to western biologists, through political factors (Viet Nam, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, the relevant parts of China, most of North-east India, Bhutan), and capacity-building programmes for national conservation personnel were only just beginning in some areas. Hence, there was a very weak information base upon which to make this assessment. In the intervening quarter-century, most of this area has opened up, and there have been many records of this species, the vast majority unpublished (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2014), indicating that this 1989 assessment was unduly pessimistic.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

The balance between these threats and their current severity varies somewhat between ‘South Asia’ (here comprising India, Nepal, presumably Bhutan and perhaps Pakistan) and ‘Southeast Asia’ (here comprising China, Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand and Bangladesh). In 2008 it was considered that there was insufficient information to judge for Myammar into which group it would fit however as of 2014 it is now clear that trends in habitats clearance, hunting pressure and conservation management in Myanmar are very similar to ‘Southeast Asia’ especially Cambodia. Sri Lanka and Australia are considered outside the native range so not covered in detail here.In the Mekong countries of Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand, Viet Nam and also probably China and Bangladesh, hunting has been, and remains, the primary direct threat to the species. In addition to local consumption of meat, the main factor presently driving such hunting is the thriving and probably increasing national, regional and East Asian markets trade in bushmeat, abetted by markets for traditional medicinal products derived from deer species and for trophy antlers (Tordoff et al. 2005, Maxwell et al. 2007). It is also possible that hunting could be stimulated by demand for captive animals, especially from zoos and menageries in Thailand and Cambodia (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), although as of 2014 this is almost certainly insignificant (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). The species is apparently easy to hunt compared with other sympatric deer (e.g. Peacock 1933, Dumas 1944), and fawns are likely to be very vulnerable to dogs which almost always accompany human parties during excursions, however, brief, outside farm and residential land, even if these are not for hunting (Tordoff et al. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Hunting itself has been greatly augmented by habitat loss: the vast majority of tall floodplain grasslands have been lost in the region due to the suitability of such habitat for human settlement and agriculture, and only very small patches remain. This huge extent of habitat loss probably occurred largely after Hog Deer had been hunted down to negligible numbers (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The coastal lowland open habitat mosaic of southwestern Cambodia in contrast remained extensive and relatively little changed even in 2008, however development pressure in the area has increased enormously in the intervening years, with considerable developments of agricultural and agroforestry plantations (Timmins and Sechrest 2010, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Given these threats, which are ongoing, Hog Deer is one of the most threatened large mammals in Indochina (Timmins and Duckworth 2000, Tordoff et al. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The most significant challenge to conserving the species there is the uncertainty involved with long term protected area-based conservation management. As of the end of 2014 there are still no specific conservation measures for the species in Cambodia; none of the known subpopulations occur substantially within a protected area and given hunting pressure and trends in habitat loss, these subpopulations are highly likely to be extirpated in the short to medium term (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).Even in South Asia, where many protected areas are effective in conserving populations of large ungulates, Hog Deer declined precipitously in the 20th century through habitat loss and hunting. It is still in decline even within some protected areas (e.g. Bhowmik 2002; see below). In India, habitat loss to cultivation has greatly reduced the area available to Hog Deer, and has continued to do so outside protected areas even in recent decades (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Johnsingh et al. (2004) stated that high levels of malaria had previously discouraged settlement, agriculture, and thus habitat conversion in the Terai Arc Landscape, and that the conquering of malaria has made the Indian side of the Terai Arc Landscape ""one of the most densely populated regions of [India, with a] population growing at a much higher rate than the rest of [India]. Most of the fertile Terai plains have been taken over by agriculture"". Johnsingh et al. (2004) stated that controlling disturbance to Lagga Bagga forest block in Pilibhit Forest Division (now within a tiger reserve; B. Long pers. comm. 2008) is a huge challenge: many people rely on it for firewood, thatch grass and fodder, and that intensive protection and participatory management with these people are required to restore the area. Such a threat profile is typical of areas supporting Hog Deer. Outside protected areas, some Hog Deer remain in woodland areas where densities are very low, and although animals do appear to breed in such situations, it is unclear in the absence of adjacent high-density river plains populations how viable such woodland populations will be in the long term (A. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006). Protected areas are encroached for cultivation and even more so for livestock grazing, which is surely increasing pressure on Hog Deer along with many other species. As a grazing species, Hog Deer numbers are likely to be severely depressed by competition with domestic livestock (by analogy with other wild ruminants, as detailed by Madhusudan 2004), although no data were traced on this. Domestic stock are ubiquitous in all areas outside the protected area network and even occur in many within it, specifically at least: Chitwan; Orang; Jaldapara; and Gorumara (Johnsingh et al. 2004, R.H. Emslie pers. comm., B.N. Talukdar pers. comm., S.S. Bist pers. comm.).Most subpopulations in India are under severe threat from hunting (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008), although the largest subpopulation of the species, in Kaziranga, has been secured from this threat for many years. Poaching occurs in protected areas throughout the Indian range, especially in north Bengal, and can be associated with other human uses of protected areas perceived to be more legitimate, such as grazing camps (Biswas 2004). Many old skulls of Hog Deer were found across Arunachal Pradesh and Assam during the survey of Biswas et al. (2002). On average two to three skulls were recorded from most houses in villages randomly visited during the survey in Arunachal Pradesh. Regularly, shots were heard and machans (tree-houses made for poaching) were found during the surveys in Nameri National Park, Sonai-Rupai Wildlife Sanctuary and Namdapha Tiger Reserve. According to questionnaire, 52% of responses reported high incidence of Hog Deer hunting in neighbouring areas. Hunting was reported as the primary reason for the sudden decline of the Hog Deer population from north Bengal since 1877. Biswas et al. (2002) detailed evidence of Hog Deer hunting during the survey and past records from the district of Cooch Behar (West Bengal) back to the 18th century. Even today, in high-profile areas such a Corbett Tiger Reserve and Rajaji National Park, there are still instances of deer poaching, and poaching has seriously depleted abundance of large mammals in most of the Terai Arc Landscape. Some poaching is driven by a desire to seek adventure, the thrill of shikar and wild meat, some by crushing poverty of daily wage labourers and others, some to take advantage of the business opportunity of supplying a lucrative trade. Poaching is done with dogs, snares, spears and guns (Johnsingh et al. 2004). Outside protected areas in India, enforcement of anti-hunting regulations is patchy and, unless there is effective specific intervention, all Hog Deer subpopulations in such areas will become extirpated in the near future from hunting (A. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Hog Deer avidly eats rice and so in the past was “destroyed ruthlessly on such grounds” (Peacock 1933). It seems unlikely that killing Hog Deer solely for reduction of crop damage is nowadays a reason for population decline, although it may be a convenient excuse to kill deer. Most serious is that the predilection of Hog Deer to eat rice is likely to bring them into closer contact with people and therefore to increase easy opportunities for hunting. In Kratie, Cambodia, Hog Deer occur near, and seasonally forage in, rice fields, especially in the early rainy season. People set traps for wild pigs Sus species, which are more abundant than Hog Deer, and the traps sometimes kill Hog Deer. The local people now are reportedly refraining from using indiscriminate traps in the Hog Deer area, but such cooperation is unlikely to continue forever, because crop predation by pigs is really a problem (A. Maxwell pers. comm. 2008).In today’s highly fragmented subpopulations which have limited dispersal possibility, flooding may take heavy tolls, especially in the Brahmaputra flood plain (Q. Qureshi pers. comm. 1995). In Kaziranga National Park, where the largest subpopulation of this species is found, flooding is likely to be a major threat: in 1998 the flood reduced the subpopulation to less than half its pre-flood number (A. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006). High floods both lead to drowning as animals are washed away also falling victim to road kill (A. Choudhury pers. comm. 2014). The situation is similar in Nepal where Hog Deer appears to be especially vulnerable because of the short-grass habitats it usually uses during flood season, and in protected area like Koshi Tappu, flooding probably causes wide fluctuations in population numbers (H.S. Baral pers. comm. 2008). Hog Deer subpopulations appear to rebound quickly even from heavy losses, but the fragmentation and increasing isolation of subpopulations into small areas, sometimes with no linkage to suitable higher ground, makes periodic losses from flooding a high risk for future site-level extinctions. Flooding is also a danger because, except in areas of effective anti-poaching activity, by marooning Hog Deer on little patches of high ground it makes them more easy to hunt (Peacock 1933).A further threat also reflects the colossal habitat fragmentation in recent centuries. Prime Hog Deer habitats are naturally dynamic, and on a living floodplain new areas of grasslands are constantly created through natural processes to replace those changing through natural succession to woody vegetation; creation occurs through traumatic change of floodplain stream and land layout during spates (Dinerstein 1979, Lehmkuhl 1994, Peet et al. 1999). This is incompatible with farming and other human land-uses, which seek a predictable landscape. Hence, within Hog Deer range, there are very few active natural floodplains in which pre-exploitation processes shape the landscape in this way. Thus, the grasslands which are the prime habitat of Hog Deer generally require active management. In some protected areas grasslands are being lost by succession of wooded habitats, for example Chitwan (A. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006) and Bardia (Odden et al. 2005). By contrast, annual burning in Kaziranga, while maintaining a grass habitat, has rapidly changed the grassland structure and composition and how this change affects Hog Deer subpopulations is not known (S. Deb Roy pers. comm. 1996). In Nepal there is also succession of different grassland types and in particular Imperata cylindrica grasslands, which Hog Deer appears to favour at certain times of the year (Biswas 2004), are being replaced by larger cane grasses (H. S. Baral pers. comm. 2008). Locally, conservation management of grasslands to benefit rhinoceroses, for instance in Jaldapara, might negatively affect Hog Deer (Biswas 2004 and references within).The invasive creeper Mikania sp. threatens Hog Deer’s favoured grasslands both within and outside protected areas, and after flooding and poaching is possibly the next most serious threat to the species in Nepal (H.S. Baral pers. comm. 2008). In combination with invasion by Chromolaena odorata (=Eupatorium odoratum), heavy livestock grazing pressure and invasion of some grasslands by Acacia catechu and Dalbergia sissou, the grassland area in Chitwan has been reduced from 20% to 4.7% of the national park (R.H. Emslie pers. comm.). Mikania sp. are also carpeting large areas of non-forest habitats in the Hukaung Valley, Myanmar (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). Lantana camara is also displacing native plants widely, and in Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, the creeper Tiliacora acuminata is proliferating across Hog Deer habitat (Kumar et al. 2002, Johnsingh et al. 2004, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). In Assam an invasive Mimosa sp. threatens the habitat in sites like Kaziranga and Orang National Parks, whereas in Manas National Park an invasive Lea sp. has become a major threat to the grassland habitat of the hog deer (B. Talukdar pers. comm. 2008). Floodplain grasslands are strongly affected in their pace of natural succession by water flows and levels, and seasonal patterns in them. Hydropower development changes these parameters and thus threatens habitat, including a project under consideration across the Mekong which would affect the sole known subpopulation of A. p. annamiticus (that in Cambodia), and another across the Karnali river which would modify habitats in Bardia, Nepal (Odden et al. 2005). There have been proposals to dam the Brahmaputra River in Arunachal Pradesh, and should this happen, this could very negatively affect the habitat quality and Hog Deer carrying capacity of major parks like Kaziranga in future (by preventing or reducing the pulse of nutrients brought in by regular large floods, as well as changes in water levels and flows). In Jaldapara Sanctuary, the River Torsa no longer overflows as a result of massive flood-control structures. As a result the water table in the sanctuary is receding and the natural water-bodies and wallow-pools are slowly drying up (S.S. Bist pers. comm.).Disease epidemics spreading from domestic livestock presumably pose a threat, especially given the close overlap of Hog Deer and domestic livestock in South Asia, the high densities especially of the latter, and the small and localised nature of Hog Deer subpopulations.In Sri Lanka the continued survival of the introduced subpopulations depends on controlling hunting and maintaining traditional agricultural land use practices. The land is too intensively cultivated for the establishment of protected areas within the range of the species. Threats in the rest of the introduced range are not reviewed here.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

However since 2010 large-scale habitat loss and conversion of Deciduous Dipterocarp Forest for Economic and Social Land Concessions, which also increased hunting pressure, has become an equally significant threat in Cambodia. In addition the highly fragmented nature and small population size of the remaining subpopulations makes the species’ perhaps vulnerable to small population threats. The influence of traditional medicinal trade is uncertain, but may be very significant as products derived from the species are reportedly more valuable than are those from other deer (Zeng et al. 2005). Some hunting in Cambodia is probably also driven by a demand for captive animals especially from zoos and menageries in Thailand and Cambodia (Salter and Sayer 1986, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The species is apparently easy to hunt compared with other sympatric deer, and fawns are likely to be very vulnerable to dogs which almost always accompany human parties during forest visits, even when the visits are not for hunting (Tordoff et al. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Predation of fawns by domestic dogs, which are ubiquitous within dry forests in lowland Indochina, has been identified as a threat to the Savannakhet subpopulation in Lao PDR (P. Vongkhamheng pers. comm. 2013) and may also impact the scattered Cambodian subpopulations particularly those outside the cores of protected areas. The effects of hunting have been exacerbated by forest loss and fragmentation, which is rapidly accelerating with human population in-migration, infrastructural developments (especially roads), commercial agricultural expansion, economic land speculation and mineral extraction. Selective logging was initially one of the main driving forces, but it is now of relatively minor concern (Tordoff et al. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Human in-migration and subsequent agricultural encroachment into forest areas tends to concentrate on those habitats most used by Eld’s Deer, and thus the species has suffered more than most from hunting (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, Tordoff et al. 2005). In-migration is also a commonly associated with land concessions in Cambodia. Indeed the loss of considerable (~500 km2) Eld’s Deer habitat in Preah Vihear province in 2011-12 was associated with a Social Land Concession given to military families. As an inhabitant of relatively open habitat through which travel and transport are easy, it is also likely to have been more heavily affected by a given level of hunting effort compared with species of rugged, dense hill evergreen forest; a similar scenario has been postulated for Jungle Cat Felis chaus (Duckworth et al. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008).  Probably the most significant challenge to conserving the species in Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam is the uncertainty involved with long-term protected-area based conservation management. No protected areas within Cambodia are safe from conversion to other land-uses. Protected areas, even those that at present have relatively active and effective management, face an uncertain future with the possibility of excision of conservation status largely for land concessions, the lack of long-term security in external funding adequate to maintain high standards of management, fluctuations in political support necessary to uphold high protection standards and the consequential difficulties of maintaining a motivated and well-trained staff.  Protected areas, primarily those along the tri-border area of Thailand where it adjoins both Lao PDR and Cambodia, and the Huai Kha Khaeng WS, were unable to prevent the decline and likely extirpation of Eld’s Deer from the wild in Thailand (see Bhumpakphan et al. 2004). This decline was likely to have been driven by much the same reasons as in Indochina. If any Eld’s Deer do remain in the wild there, it seems unlikely that they will ever recover unassisted. There are few data on the introduced populations of R. e. thamin to non-native areas (see Bhumpakphan et al. 2004). Threats to the species in Myanmar appear to be similar to those in Indochina, with perhaps more emphasis on exploitation for meat (Salter and Sayer 1986, Myint Aung pers. comm. 1997).  Habitat loss in some range areas is still ongoing (Myint Aung 2004) and Koy et al. (2005) found that ‘patterns of percentage tree canopy-cover were negatively correlated with human population density, suggesting further threats to Eld's Deer populations as the human population continues to grow’.  A support programme for the main site, Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary, had an encouraging start but following cessation of external funding the population is now in decline (see Population), while other protected areas in the country either failed to include appropriate habitat for the species (e.g. Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park) or failed to protect the habitat even within the protected area (e.g. Shwesettaw Wildlife Sanctuary).  Overall, the challenges of generating functional protected areas which will sustain Eld’s Deer are similar to, and under current conditions even more daunting than, those outlined for Cambodia, Lao PDR and Viet Nam (above). In general, protected areas in Myanmar are themselves highly threatened by major shortfalls in funding and political will (Rao et al. 2002). The population on Hainan faces an uncertain future as a wild animal without hands-on management, because protected area management has not been effective in preventing poaching (see Pang et al. 2003, Zeng et al. 2005). Loss of suitable habitat has been extensive and is continuing, but large enough areas probably remain for further population expansion, provided that herds in such situations could be adequately protected from poaching (see Zeng et al. 2005). Genetic analyses of the population suggest that there is low diversity resulting from a population bottleneck, and this could in the future threaten the population’s viability (Pang et al. 2003, Balakrishnan et al. 2003). Indian populations of Eld’s Deer declined due to some combination of hunting and habitat loss. Even at the Keibul Lamjao National Park, the habitats of the deer have been encroached for grazing, cultivation, and fish farming (Green 1990), but this seems to be mainly now under control (Singh 2004). This population is now most threatened by a hydro-electric project in Loktak Lake which maintains unnaturally high water levels during the dry season and has changed water flow patterns and water quality in the lake (Singh 2004). These in turn appear to be affecting the ecology of the Keibul Lamjao National Park floating marsh (Singh 2004, Sanjit et al. 2005). Floods could also seriously affect the population, which has no high ground to which it can easily escape (Singh 2004). There may also be the threat of low genetic diversity resulting from the effect of a very small founder population (Balakrishnan et al. 2004) and as a small isolated population it must also be considered at risk from disease transfer from domestic livestock, and potentially other factors. Eld’s Deer readily grazes on rice and some other agricultural products (McShea and Myint Aung 2001). This provides some potential for human-wildlife conflict, but under current conditions populations seem to be too low for this to be a serious problem (e.g. at the Chonbuly district population, Savannakhet province, Lao PDR; J.W. Duckworth in litt. 2008). Retributory killing may become more of a threat if populations are successfully rebuilt in areas close to agriculture.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

The most potent threats are from water pollution, and habitat fragmentation caused by the construction of hydro-electric plants, water extraction, and dam and reservoir construction (Queiroz 1999, Palomo and Gisbert 2002, Cabral et al. 2005). Other threats are direct persecution from fishermen who incorrectly believe this species to be a threat to fish stocks, especially trout, or from over-eager collectors. Poison and explosives are used as fishing methods in Portugal, which would kill the desman (Cabral et al. 2005). The escape of North American mink (Neovison vison) from fur farms in northern Iberia might be negatively impacting populations in Galicia. It is predated by otters in Galicia (forming up to 5% of their diet) (Palomo and Gisbert 2002).Climate change is anticipated to be a serious threat to the desman in the near future.

R. Rajaonson (pers. comm.) estimates that deforestation in eastern forest increased from 0.5% per annum between 2005-2010 to 0.94% per annum in 2010-2013. Near Ranomafana National Park, the species is found more frequently in larger than in smaller fragments (Gerber et al. 2012). High levels of illegal settlement in protected areas, especially around the Bay of Antongil, are linked to artisanal mining (for quartz) and logging of rosewood, and hunting for food using dogs has increased greatly in these areas as a result. Some villages have seen increases in populations of between 200 and 300% (C. Golden pers. comm. 2015).Hunting and bushmeat consumption appear to be less of a concern for Broad-striped Vontsira across the Makira landscape than it is for some other carnivores. Only seven Broad-striped Vontsiras were reported consumed across four villages (55 households) from 2005 to 2011 near the Makira Natural Park. However, hunting rates were still positively associated with Broad-striped Vontsira occupancy, demonstrating that hunting efforts are highest where this carnivore is most active/abundant (Farris et al. in review a).Golden et al. (in press) reported three Broad-striped Vontsiras hunted in one year at Betampona Strict Nature Reserve. Household interviews conducted by Madagasikara Voakajy (pers. comm. 2014) in the Moramanga region of eastern Madagascar in 2008-2009 suggest that 284 (17%) of 1,633 respondents interviewed in 129 villages had eaten Broad-striped Vontsira in the preceding year.Broad-striped Vontsira showed strong temporal activity overlap with the exotic Small Indian Civet Viverricula indica, revealing the potential for interactions and competition (Farris et al. in review b). Co-occurrence models demonstrate that the vontsira does not occur at sites where dog and/or Small Indian Civet activity is very high. Broad-striped Vontsira probability of occupancy is greatly decreased in the presence of both dogs and civets (Farris et al. in review c).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The region has suffered intense human colonization over the last 30 years because of a major agrarian programme, which has attracted huge numbers of immigrants. Agricultural activities include the cultivation of rice and coffee; cattle ranching and selective timber extraction also occur. The region is characterized by rapid rates of deforestation (estimates vary from 40,000 to 100,000 ha per year) and fragmentation, and has lost at least 40% of its forest cover, mainly from the low-altitude river basins (the preferred habitat of this species) over the last 20 years (Mark 2003, DeLuycker 2006). The construction of a two-lane all-weather road, which was asphalted in 2003 - La Carretera Marginal, Via Marginal, or Carretera Fernando Belaunde Terry - which runs all the way to the coast (Chiclayo) and past Tarapoto has contributed to the influx of immigrants and a change from subsistence to small-scale farming. It has also altered the spatial distribution of human settlers, who now follow the highway far into the valley and high forests, and the lack planning or state-regulated land occupation and use puts protected areas and remaining forests at risk (DeLuycker 2006).  The species is not found in any large protected areas of San Martin. Recent studies (Bóveda-Penalba et al. 2009) determined that an estimated 60% of the species original range has already been lost, and its current range comprises only small fragments of secondary forest. All groups encountered live in small highly degraded remnants of forest, isolated from other populations. The species is being hunted for its meat, both the Aguarunas and recent immigrants hunt this species (Mark 2003, DeLuycker 2006, Bóveda-Penalba et al. 2009). While Titis Monkeys may not be a particularly lucrative source of protein, hunting pressure is likely to increase as preferred game become scarce and fragmentation facilitates access. These Titi Monkeys are popular as pets (Mark 2003, DeLuycker 2006, Bóveda-Penalba et al. 2009) and have been found for sale at markets (Rowe and Martinez 2003, Mark 2003) and encountered along with Aotus miconax at tourist centres in the upper Mayo valley (Mark 2003).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

This has resulted in widespread deforestation and fragmentation, with very little remaining forest cover (estimated from between 5 to 10%).

These economic activities, together with urbanization, are driven by the developmental goals of local governments. The resulting small, isolated populations of titis are exposed to demographic and genetic risks, although hunting pressure is probably negligible to moderate in most cases, given their small body size.

Therefore, forest conversion there over the last few decades will have resulted in some overall population reduction. However, for a species that is common in hill evergreen forest and tolerant of degradation, very large areas remain and are likely to do so for the foreseeable future. These declines thus do not constitute a threat to the species. Moreover, the species is surviving well within remaining forests (including secondary stands), for two likely reasons: (i) it is little sought as food or for any other reason by most residents, and (ii) its scansorial nature reduces its exposure to snares and other traps, as well as allowing easy escape from domestic and feral dogs. Therefore, no significant threats at the population level are known to the species in South-east Asia, although it is no doubt below carrying capacity in heavily hunted areas such as Lao PDR and Viet Nam. It is occasionally hunted in Siberia (Russia) and DPR Korea for its fur (A. Abramov pers. comm. 2006, J. W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006) but this does not constitute a global threat, rather it affects local populations at most.

The expansion of the agricultural frontier, together with inadequate agricultural practices and land/agrarian reforms, have been the main drivers of the loss of natural ecosystems (Peyton et al. 1998, Yerena 1998, Young 1998, Vina and Cavelier 1999, Ataroff and Rada 2000, Armenteras et al. 2011, Portillo-Quintero et al. 2012). Mining and oil exploitation are becoming an increasing menace not only to bears, but to local communities due to land expropriation, loss of habitat connectivity, and contamination of water and soil (Young and León 1999, Bury 2002, Bebbington et al. 2008, Bebbington 2009). Conversion of land to coca crops and the drug trade, together with guerrilla groups in some parts of the Andes, favours a lawless land-use system that also impacts the quality of Andean Bear habitats and the bear's probability of long-term survival (Rodríguez et al. 2003, Yerena et al. 2007, Dávalos et al. 2011, García-Rangel 2012).  Illegal Killing Illegal killing is an important, but underestimated threat for Andean Bears. Based on a review of the literature, an average of about 180 bears are known to be killed per year across its range—it is suspected that the real number is much higher, and is likely increasing. For example, recent assessments in northern Ecuador showed unprecedented numbers of cattle killed by bears (at least 320 during the period 2009-2014; Zukowski and Ormsby 2016), as more people are turning to dairy cow farming as a livelihood (Jampel 2016). Bears are killed for retaliation against crop or livestock depredations (or protection against future depredations), for cultural or medical beliefs, and for commercial trade (Orejuela and Jorgenson 1999, Peyton 1999, Rumiz and Salazar 1999, Rodríguez et al. 2003, Yerena et al. 2007, Figueroa 2008, Figueroa and Stucchi 2009, Lameda 2011, E.D. Rodríguez pers. comm. 2014, M.P. Viteri pers. comm. 2014). Since the number of bears killed is likely underestimated by a wide margin, the effects of such killing on bear populations is hard to assess, but rates of killing are high in some areas. Sanchez-Mercado et al. (2008, 2014) estimated that up to 36% of the bear’s distribution in the Cordillera de Merida in Venezuela was within an “ecological trap”, due to human threats. These authors estimated that the effects of this threat combined with habitat fragmentation could be fostering an extinction probability higher than 50% over the next 50 years across this mountain range. Bears are killed during opportunistic encounters, while sport hunting, or as retaliation after damaging crops, particularly maize, or killing livestock (Goldstein 1991, 2002; Peyton 1999, Poveda 1999, Morales Vargas 2003, Goldstein et al. 2006, Sánchez-Mercado et al. 2008, Torres 2008).  Climate Change Global projections of effects of climate change show a general tendency towards upslope displacement of the mountain biome, suggesting that the Tropical Andes is among the most vulnerable region to climate change (Malcom et al. 2006, Urrutia and Vuille 2009, Beaumont et al. 2011). However, the heterogeneity of this hotspot shows a more complex response (Tovar et al. 2013) affecting phenological patterns and increasing species vulnerability with predictions of species loss ranging from 20-50% due to range contractions for many taxa (Cuesta-Camacho et al. 2008, Lawler et al. 2009, Aguirre et al. 2011, Graham et al. 2011, Hoffmann and Sgrò 2011, Chen et al. 2011, Velásquez-Tibatá et al. 2013, Richardson et al. 2013, Pacifici et al. 2015). It is likely that all ecosystems associated with Andean Bears will exhibit reductions in their extension. With an increment of +0.74 C in the last century, and a projected increase of 4.3 +/- 0.7 C by 2100 (IPCC 2013), extensive changes in habitat are expected: the Tropical high altitude grasslands is the most fragile ecosystem, with an estimated loss of 30% (Tovar et al. 2013) due to the lack of upslope area for migration. Projected reduction in annual rainfall (IPCC 2013) is likely to affect species highly dependent on humidity such as epiphytic bromeliads (Colwell et al. 2008, Svenning and Condit, 2008, Tewsksbury et al. 2008). Tropical dry and moist shrublands are likely to lose 24% of their area (Tovar et al. 2013), mainly due to a significant variation in the number of dry months (IPCC 2013), while a loss of 18% in area was estimated for Tropical moist lowland and montane forests and Tropical dry forests due to upslope displacements. Furthermore, the extensive (and intensive) land use by human activities in Paramo grasslands, are likely to encroach even further, affecting not only the biodiversity associated to this ecosystem, but also the ecosystem services this biome provides to the region.  Changes in climate regimes must therefore be considered as a growing threat for Andean Bears, as they are likely to alter habitat quality as well as land-use patterns, and increase the probability of human–bear encounters and conflict (Karanth and Chellam 2009, Aguirre et al. 2011, Hoffmann and Sgrò 2011, Chen et al. 2011, Sheridan and Bickford 2011, Mysterud 2013, Ripple et al. 2014). Even more, the areas considered to be most vulnerable to climate change across the Andes are those considered important for Andean bears including: Yanachaga Chemillen National Park (NP) (Peru), Manu NP (Peru), Madidi NP (Bolivia), Apolobamba ANMI (Bolivia), Carrasco NP (Bolivia) and Amboro NP (Bolivia) (Hoffman et al. 2011).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

However, alteration and fragmentation of habitats (through agriculture, forestry, fires, and infrastructure development) may impact upon certain Capra pyrenaica populations, and competition with the introduced the aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) might become a conservation problem in the near future (Cabral et al. 2005, J. M. Pérez pers. comm. 2006). The aoudad was introduced during the 1970s in southeastern Spain, and recently an important range expansion of this exotic ungulate has been reported (Cassinello et al. 2004); competition between these two ungulate species can be expected. The impact of hunting (predominantly for trophies) has not been scientifically assessed (J. M. Pérez pers. comm. 2006), but the poaching of large dominant males might alter gene flow (J. Herrero pers. comm. 2006). However, hunting levels are broadly under control. Outbreaks of mange (Sarcoptes scabiei) occur sporadically and have caused at least one major population crash (Shackleton 1997, Palomo and Gisbert 2002). Wild goats are occasionally killed by accident during wild boar hunting-drives with dogs (J. Herrero pers. comm. 2006). Previously, the population was kept low by competition with domestic livestock, which restricted wild goats to marginal habitats. The causes of C. p. pyrenaica' s demise are unknown, but there are a number of hypotheses including competition for food with chamois, inbreeding depression, parasite infections from domestic livestock, climatic conditions, poaching, and low fertility due to plant secondary compounds (Shackleton 1997).

Although deforestation rates in Southeast Asia have slowed substantially, they are still among the highest in the world (FAO 2011). An increasing number of hydropower projects in countries such as Bhutan, also have the potential to negatively impact the species. In addition, the species is threatened by increasing levels of illegal hunting and poaching for consumption, and for the sale of pelts and body parts (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Duckworth et al. 1999, Lynam et al. 2006, Khan 2008, H. Rahman pers. comm., P. Riordan pers. comm., S. Mukherjee pers. comm., T. Gray pers. comm., S. Dahal pers. comm.). There is thought to be some level of poaching or hunting of the species in every country across its range. Pelts have been recorded being traded along the Myanmar-Thailand border, and in Sumatra (Duckworth et al. 1999, Pusparini et al. 2014), and skins are reported from several sites in northeast India (Aiyadurai et al. 2010, A. Datta pers. comm.). Poaching pressure is particularly high in China and Viet Nam, where the species may soon face extirpation.  In Viet Nam, there is some evidence that the species is increasingly targeted as a substitute for Tiger skins and parts, as Tigers become more difficult to obtain. There have been several incidences of confiscated Golden Cat pelts which were painted to resemble that of a Tiger (D. Willcox pers. comm.). Snaring appears to be on the rise across much of mainland Southeast Asia, and constitutes a major threat to the species D. Willcox pers. comm.). In Bangladesh, several recent specimens indicate that the species is  commonly hunted by indigenous peoples in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Conflict with humans due to livestock depredation is also thought to be an issue for the species. Retribution killing of the species in response to chicken depredation was recorded in Sumatra (McCarthy 2013).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Abbott's Duiker is also affected by loss of habitat due to agricultural encroachment, and selective logging.

A recent study (Monadjem et al. in press) shows mining has a direct impact on the species, with the likely cause an increase in siltation of its aquatic habitat. Mining activities have devastated the Liberian sector of Mount Nimba and habitat conservation is generally ineffective (Nicoll and Rathbun 1990). However, the East Nimba Nature Reserve (which falls on the Liberian side of the mountain) has become a focal point for offsetting biodiversity losses by ArcelorMittal Liberia operations elsewhere in the region, and there is hope that this reserve will remain protected. It has a relatively large and healthy Micropotamogale lamottei population (Monadjem 2013). The Nimba Mountain in Guinea and Liberia remains under severe threat from iron ore mining, as does the neighbouring Putu Range (another Micropotamogale stronghold) (Decher et al. 2016, Jakob Fahr pers. comm). Wetland rice agriculture introduced in 1980 to the Nimba region also resulted in large-scale habitat conversion to rice paddies (Vogel 2013).

Other important threats include expansion of livestock herding into remote and previously unused areas (Fox and Bårdsen 2005), for instance Chiru in the Chang Tang region now shares rangeland with >8 million livestock (Harris 2008); road building, facilitating the expansion of agriculture and illegal hunting (Yin et al. 2006); and fencing of pastures on the Tibetan plateau (Fox et al. 2009). Construction of the Beijing-Lhasa railway threatened to divide the Chiru's range but engineering measures, such as underpasses, have allowed the Chiru's migration to continue to some extent. Chiru are also vulnerable to severe winter conditions, especially heavy snow, which can confine populations to limited areas and can result in disproportionate death of young, subadults, and females, presumably from malnutrition (Leslie and Schaller 2008).

Rehabilitation attempts at these sites have proved largely ineffective. These power stations form the backbone of South Africa's electricity network, and disturbance is likely to increase as human populations grow and the demand for power increases. The widespread practice of allowing cattle to graze in marshes and dense grasslands near water during dry winter months leads to trampling and a loss of cover, and this undoubtedly impacts severely on this species; likewise, ranchers often burn such areas to provide fresh graze at the end of the dry winter, which must adversely affect through predation and resource loss given the tendency of this species to forage above-ground under dense vegetative cover. Some areas in which they formerly occurred (e.g., Tshwane (Pretoria) West) have been completely transformed by urbanization and industrialization. Currently, there are only a handful of sites (three in KZN Midlands, three in Mpumalanga) where there are conclusive signs of their presence, but given its cryptic nature and lack of sustained surveying effort, this species may prove to be more resilient and widespread than current data indicate.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Uncontested land speculation related to the company’s exploration is further threatening the primary forest. More recently, a hydro-electric development has been proposed in the area of highest orangutan density, which could impact roughly 100 km² of P. tapanuliensis habitat, or nearly 10% of the entire species population.

In south-central Colombia, particularly in eastern parts of the sub-montane forests and foothills of the Andes, habitat loss is due largely to the expansion of coca plantations (Davalos et al. 2016).In the Peruvian Amazon, the principal threat to Ateles belzebuth in lowland forests is hunting, while montane forest populations are susceptible to ‘accelerated deforestation and the loss of habitats for agriculture, cattle ranching and extraction of forest resources’ (Aquino et al. 2016).  Surveys conducted at the close of the last century did not encounter this species in large areas of its presumed range, indicating that a number of populations had already been extirpated (Aquino and Encarnación 1994). More recent surveys (Shanee 2012; Shanee et al. 2015; Aquino et al. 2012, 2016, 2018) identify the species as one of the most commonly hunted Peruvian primates, its hunting frequently associated with illegal logging activities and resulting in population extirpations, even within private protected areas. The expansion of coca plantations and mining (Bax and Francesconi 2018, Bax et al. 2019) contribute significantly to deforestation and habitat fragmentation within this species’ range. Llactayo et al. (2013a, 2013b) report annual deforestation rates in the states of San Martín and Loreto of 30,000 ha and 35,000 ha, respectively, and report that these are likely to increase.In Ecuador, this species remains heavily hunted and rare near human settlements (Tirira 2007, Tirira et al. 2018). According to a report of the Ministry of the Environment (2014), the Amazonian provinces where this species occurs have the highest deforestation rates in the country. A study in Yasuní carried out by Suarez et al. (2013) documented a trend of decreasing population density of this species in moderately disturbed areas and its extirpation in highly disturbed areas. In addition, several mining concessions will commence operations within the species’ range in southeastern Ecuador in the near future (S. de la Torre, pers. comm).Where it occurs in Brazilian Amazonia, Ateles belzebuth is a preferred target for both indigenous and non-indigenous populations (Peres 1990, 2000). Based on surveys of more than 100 sites between 1987 and 2005, in areas where this species  is heavily hunted, population densities are reported to have declined by as much as 50% (Peres and Palacios 2007). Soares-Filho et al. (2006) project that close to 100 mammal species in Brazilian Amazonia will lose more than 40% of their tropical forest habitat within protected areas and as much as 80% outside of those areas by the year 2050 due to the expansion of cattle and soy industries, and the construction of all-weather highways into the region’s core. This projection covers a period of approximately 45 years (three spider monkey generations) and is based upon assumptions that the current rates of deforestation and highway construction will continue, compliance with legislation requiring forest reserves on private land will remain low, and new protected areas will not be created. Of the 28 protected areas located in the five countries in which this species is known or believed to occur, only one has been established within the present century.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

It has recently slowed in some areas (e.g. Thailand, West Malaysia, Sabah, Java), in part because there is now little forest left outside protected areas; but rates are still high in some other areas (notably Sumatra, Kalimantan and Myanmar). While such conversion renders some of the species's former habitat now unsuitable, it is unlikely to be a threat to its survival or maintenance of natural range, given the species's wide altitudinal use (forest conversion rates in hills are considerably lower) and use of edge and degraded areas. Similarly, while there is some off-take and even international trade (e.g., from Thailand to USA; Van Rompaey 1993), there is nothing to suggest that this is potentially at levels threatening to the species except at the most local of levels.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Subsistence hunting is widespread and laws against commercial hunting  and other illegal activities (mining, habitat encroachment) inside  protected areas are poorly enforced throughout the C. diana range. The increasing scale of commercial hunting poses the greatest  threat (Béné et al., 2013c; Covey and McGraw 2014, Greengrass 2016). Although Diana Monkeys adopt certain behaviours to minimize mortality due to hunting (Bshary 2001, Koné and Refisch 2007), they are now rarely  found in areas with high hunting pressure, compared to areas where  hunting pressure is relatively low (N’Goran et al. 2012). In Côte d’Ivoire, the species has been extirpated from almost all the  protected areas within its Extent of Occurrence (>80%).In addition to hunting pressure, large-scale deforestation in the  region, through mining, logging, conversion to agricultural land and  charcoal production, continues to reduce the habitat available to this  species (McGraw 1998, Tweh et al. 2014, Bitty et al. 2015, WCF 2015).  Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea each lost between 14 and 21% of their  total forest cover between 2001 and 2017, and dominant drivers of loss  continue (www.globalforestwatch.org).Combining the significant loss of suitable habitat with intense poaching  pressure, it is suspected that the total  population of C. diana has declined by more than 50% during the last three generations. ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In aggregate, habitat conversion has led to its loss from most of its ancestral range. High levels of malaria discouraged settlement, agriculture and thus habitat conversion in the Terai Arc Landscape until recently. The conquering of malaria has made the Indian side of the Terai Arc Landscape ""one of the most densely populated regions of [India] and the [human] population is growing at a much higher rate than the rest of [India]. Most of the fertile terai plains have been taken over by agriculture."" (Johnsingh et al. 2004: 32). Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary (203 km2) is one of the few remnants of terai habitat in India (Johnsingh et al. 2004). This deer's habitat is now reduced to isolated fragments as a result of agricultural encroachment and the destruction through habitat conversion of wetlands; the wet grasslands were seen as useless areas (they were termed ‘blanks’). Conversion took place largely during the 1930s–1960s (Qureshi et al. 2004). Isolation into small, fragmented, populations increases the likelihood of localised extinctions, including those through chance events such as extreme weather and disease, as well as compounding the effects of ‘situation-normal’ threats like hunting.Habitat degradation is still problematic within protected areas supporting Barasingha. Grass, timber and fuelwood cutting by local people degrade the surviving habitat, which lies mostly within protected areas, and external threats include change in river dynamics due to human developmental activities, increase in siltation and reduced flow of water during critical periods of summer. Protected area management practices are sometimes questionable, e.g. the current practice of grassland burning to control woody succession needs to be done in form of a mosaic, and harrowing should be discouraged as it seems to deteriorate grassland condition and promote occupation by unpalatable grass species like Cymbopogon spp. Many grasslands and woodlands have weed infestation (e.g. Sesbania spp.); manual weed removal in Dudhwa and Kaziranga yielded good results for habitat of Barasingha (Qureshi et al. 1995, 2004). Although there seems to be no direct analysis of the effect of domestic stock grazing on this deer, in other wild ungulate communities studied in India they cause a major depression of densities of grazing species (e.g. Madhusudan 2004), and pending direct data, this should be assumed to be the case with Barasingha. Barasingha populations recovered in parts of North and Central India once grazing by domestic stock was controlled (Schaller 1967, Martin 1977, Schaff 1978, Singh 1984, Qureshi et al. 1995). Serious efforts remain necessary to control grazing in Hastinapur, Jhilmil tal and Katerniaghat (Qureshi et al. 2004). The grasslands and wetlands of the Terai arc landscape and the obligate species that they support, even those within protected areas are besieged by a multitude of threats which synergistically bode badly for the future (see also Red List accounts for Hog Deer Axis porcinus and Great Indian Rhinoceros Rhinoceros unicornis).Barasingha meat is not considered a delicacy, being seen as less palatable than the meat of Hog Deer Axis porcinus and Chital A. axis (Qureshi et al. 1994) but Barasingha are still poached for antlers and meat (to local markets), especially populations outside protected areas permanently or seasonally (Qureshi et al. 2004). The hide is used to manufacture whips and other items (A. Singh pers. comm.). Particularly in Bangladesh, hunting seems to have been responsible for national extinction because the Sundarbans mangrove forest is still extensive (Md Anwarul Islam in litt. 2008). It is likely to remain a highly significant threat for populations outside well-secured protected areas.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

Habitat in San Luis Potosí has also been heavily converted to agriculture, and the extraction of water has dried up soils and grasslands. This species is sometimes erroneously considered as competitors with livestock for forage, and have been the target of intensive and widespread poisoning efforts, which led to the extirpation of the population in Zacatecas (Koprowski et al. 2016).

It is the armadillo species that     is most sought after by hunters in the llanos of Colombia (Trujillo     and Superina 2013). In addition, the species is affected by land     conversion for agro-industry farming (mainly rice, soy and corn),     timber plantations, and palm oil plantations.      Estimates from the Orinoquia region of Colombia suggest that     approximately 10% of the natural habitat of this species is     subjected to land use change every year. The area used for oil palm,     rice, timber, soy, and corn plantations in the Orinoquia region is     projected to increase more than ten-fold over the next decade, especially due to a significant increase in biofuel and timber production     (Aristizábal et al. 2000, Dishington 2007, Fedearroz 2008, IAvH     2009,     CRECE 2010, Fedepalma 2008, 2012; Dombro in press), which calls for     an urgent assessment of the potential effects on the D. sabanicola     population. Although the tolerance of this small armadillo to     modified habitats has not been studied to date, reports from locals     suggest that it does survive in areas with extensive cattle     ranching, but that subpopulations have declined or even disappeared     from cultivated areas. It is probable that the species cannot     survive in cultivated areas in which agrochemicals are used for     insect control, as they severely reduce the availability of the main     food source of D. sabanicola.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Some populations have been negatively affected by rodenticides.Populations of this species periodically increase to high levels and decline rapidly (due to long-term drought, excessive amounts of precipitation, flooding, or other factors). Sometimes these fluctuations lead to local extirpation (USFWS 1998). When large expanses of connected habitat existed, local extinction was not a great problem because some surviving populations eventually increased, and individuals recolonized areas where they had been eliminated (USFWS 1998). Current population fragmentation inhibits or prevents such recolonization.

Since its rediscovery in 2001 there has been significant conversion of habitat to agriculture and mining for copper and gold within the current known range of the species on Cebu. Evans (1993) reported that less than 4% of Negros Island was forested, with small patches of degraded forest in the central and southern portion of the island. Roosts of the species are disturbed by guano miners.  The largest remaining fragment of forest within the range of this species on Cebu is approximately 60 ha and this is threatened by the cutting of trees for charcoal and agricultural development (Paguntalan et al. 2004)Harvest of D. chapmani for local consumption and sale has caused past population declines. Hunting is known to occur in the areas in which it has been rediscovered. In an ethnobiological survey, which included the islands of Sipalay City, out of 28 respondents, 15 reported hunting this species (A. Carino pers. comm. 2006). As a larger species, it is particularly targeted by hunters and in the past the species was sold in street markets. However, since 1995, D. chapmani has rarely been captured in caves where it has reportedly been hunted before. Interviews with hunters indicate that only about one or two individuals of D. chapmani have been taken during the 2003-2005 period indicating a population decline (Paguntalan in litt. 2006). It has been bred in captivity by collectors as a pet (L. Paguntalan pers. comm. 2006).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Hundreds of people and elephants are killed annually as a result of such conflicts. The long-term future of elephants outside protected areas, as well as in some protected areas, is therefore inextricably linked to mitigating such human–elephant conflicts, and this is one of the largest conservation challenges in Asia today (Sukumar, 1992, 2003; Hedges 2006).Asian elephants live in the region of the world with the densest human population, growing at a rate of between 1–3% per year. Because elephants require much larger areas of natural habitat than most other terrestrial mammals in Asia, they are one of the first species to suffer the consequences of habitat fragmentation and destruction and because of its great size and large food requirements, the elephant cannot co-exist with people in areas where agriculture is the dominant form of land-use. In extreme cases, elephants have been confined as so called ‘pocketed herds’ in small patches of forest in landscapes dominated by man. Such ‘pocketed herds’ represent an extreme stage in the human–elephant conflict (Olivier, 1978). In other cases elephants have been caught and taken to so-called Elephant Training Centres where they languish, lost to the wild population (Hedges et al., 2005, 2006). Poaching is a major threat to elephants in Asia too, although reliable estimates of the number of elephants killed and the quantities of ivory and other body parts collected and traded are scarce (Sukumar et al., 1998; Milliken, 2005). It has been argued that poaching is a relatively minor threat to Asian elephant because some males and all females lack tusks (Dawson and Blackburn, 1991). However, the reality is that elephants are poached for a variety of other products (including meat and leather) in addition to ivory, and poaching is now acknowledged as a threat to the long-term survival of some Asian elephant populations (e.g. Kemf and Santiapillai, 2000; Menon, 2002). Moreover, poaching of elephants for ivory is a serious problem in some parts of Asia (Sukumar, 1992; Menon et al., 1997). In Periyar Tiger Reserve in southern India, for example, ivory poaching has dramatically skewed adult sex ratios: over the 20-year period from 1969 to 1989 the adult male:female sex ratio changed from 1:6 to 1:122 (Chandran, 1990). Selective removal of tusked males has several implications for the affected populations: sex ratios obviously become highly female biased, genetic variation is reduced, and fecundity and recruitment may decline (Sukumar et al., 1998; Sukumar, 2003). Poaching of elephants is also a major problem in other parts of Asia. Large-scale hunting of elephants for ivory, bushmeat, hides, and other products has reduced their populations significantly over a wide area from Myanmar to Indonesia (Menon et al., 1997; Duckworth and Hedges, 1998; Kemf and Santiapillai, 2000; Martin and Stiles, 2002; Menon, 2002; World Wide Fund for Nature, 2002a; Hedges et al., 2005).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Additional and previously unknown threats including, but not limited to, intraguild predation, diseases, declining Springhare  populations and unsuitable farming practices have now been realised. All of these suggest that the species is becomingly increasingly threatened. New distribution data clearly indicate that the majority of the distribution occurs outside of formally protected areas (Figure 1 in Supporting Material). Indeed, the majority of protected areas are suspected to be too small to adequately conserve a viable subpopulation. Essentially, this means the conservation of the species relies on the cooperation of private landowners and managers, particularly in large conservancy areas. However, whilst the geographical distribution of the species may be greater than previously documented, the actual occurrence of the species is highly fragmented and patchy within this area (Wilson 2016), which may have resulted in the creation of island subpopulations resulting in limited dispersal opportunities and restricting genetic exchange between subpopulations. Habitat loss or changes have previously been considered the most severe threat to the species. Habitat degradation that results in the loss of prey base is a serious threat, but changing agricultural practices may, in some instances, actually benefit the species by providing artificially high rodent populations for prey and fewer apex carnivores to compete with.Perhaps the most serious long-term threat for Black-footed Cats is the loss of key resources, such as den sites and prey, from anthropogenic disturbance or habitat degradation (for example from overgrazing). They are unable to create or maintain their own dens or burrows and rely on those made by other species. Thus, the localised removal of a sympatric species, Springhare or ground squirrels with whom they have a commensal (inquilistic) relationship, may be detrimental to their continued existence in a region (B. Wilson unpubl data., Olbricht and Sliwa 1987, Sliwa 2013). Springhares are often considered as a problem or damage-causing species requiring some control measures by farmers. Although a rodent, Springhares are long-lived with a slow reproductive rate and they do not recover easily from a severe reduction in numbers. In Botswana, the unregulated subsistence hunting of the Springhares for bushmeat has resulted in the eradication of the species in some regions (Butynski 1973, 2013), and with them in all likelihood the Black-footed Cats (Wilson 2016). Bushmeat hunting may be increasing in both scope and scale within southern African savannas (Lindsey et al. 2013)The impact of mesopredators may be increasing across South African rangelands (Avenant and du Plessis 2008). In general, numbers of Black-footed Cats and other larger carnivores are negatively related due to intraguild predation. Annually, the BFCWG loses about 50% of all radio-collared cats to larger predators (BFCWG unpubl. data). The BFCWG believes that the most vulnerable individuals (kittens and subadults – below 1 kg) are the more likely victims of predation but since these individuals are difficult to monitor (too small to fit a radio collar) the actual rate of loss is unknown.  Similarly, during a study over 2006–2008 on Benfontein Farm, Northern Cape Province, two Black-footed Cats were killed by predation, at least one was from Black-Backed Jackals (Kamler et al. 2015, Wilson 2016) and another by a Caracal (Wilson 2016). Thus, although Black-footed Cats can co-exist with Black-Backed Jackals by using burrows during the day (see above for synergistic interaction) and also taking refuge in them at night during danger (A. Sliwa pers. obs.), and by partitioning activity and diets (Kamler et al. 2015), increasing Black-backed Jackal abundance caused by anthropogenic disturbance and loss of apex predators is likely to increase Black-footed Cat mortality. The BFCWG also has evidence of cats killed by traditional herding dogs and the popularity of Anatolian shepherd dogs with sheep farmers is potentially a new emerging threat (Sliwa et al. 2014, Wilson 2016).Black-footed Cats are also lost through indirect persecution, such as accidental poisonings (for example locust spraying, predator control lures/baits) and general predator persecution throughout most of their range in South Africa (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sliwa 2013). Recently, there has been an increased interest for this species in the trophy industry as witnessed by permit applications and requests made to taxidermists (Wilson 2015).The extent of road mortality on cat subpopulations is not known. The incident rate recorded in the Endangered Wildlife Trust road collision database is limited to a few records (W. Collinson unpubl. data). However, only 3% out of 790 locality records were road collision casualties (Wilson 2016).Although an inherited trait, and previously thought to be limited only to inbred captive populations, Black-footed Cats show a high prevalence for AA-amyloidosis. (Olbricht and Sliwa 1987 and Terio et al. 2008). This is a disease characterised by fibrillar protein depositions in many organs as a result of chronic inflammatory processes usually culminating in renal failure. About 70% of the documented deaths of captive cats internationally are as a result of this disease. However, the presence of amyloid in free-ranging subpopulations was detected by Terio et al. (2008) from samples provided by the BFCWG. This provides additional evidence for a species predilection and supports the existence of a possible familial type of amyloidosis in the species. Habitat fragmentation and subpopulation isolation can only exacerbate this disease at subpopulation levels, whilst at the same time, the disease is a major reason why currently global captive breeding programmes are not self-sustainable (A.Sliwa pers. comm.). As wild subpopulations become genetically isolated, reduced genetic variability threatens population viability by increasing susceptibility to disease and reducing reproductive fitness. An additional consequence of habitat fragmentation and population isolation is increased contact with other carnivores and the pathogens they carry. Because Black-footed Cats share their territory, prey base, and infectious disease susceptibility with many small carnivores, and even domestic dogs and cats, this provides numerous opportunities for disease transmission (Lamberski et al. 2009).Black-footed Cats are also vulnerable to natural disasters such as flooding of dens and den collapses (Sliwa et al. 2009). The long-term effects of climate change cannot be overlooked and may lead to changes in range, changes in timing of breeding events, increases in severe weather such as flooding and droughts, as well as increased disease patterns or risks of the spread of pathogens from parasites.Fortunately, unlike the African Wildcat, this species does not hybridize easily with other cat species. The only confirmed hybrid cases (Black-footed Cats and domestic cats) were under captive conditions (Leyhausen 1979). None have been recorded from the wild (A. Sliwa and B. Wilson pers. obs.).Current habitat trend: Previously believed to be restricted mostly to panveld and short grass areas, Black-footed Cats occupy a wide range of open arid and semi-arid habitats where they favour any vegetation cover that is low and not too dense, where they have even been sporadically recorded on fallow agricultural fields and in extremely overgrazed areas (Wilson 2016). They are therefore not restricted by habitat throughout most of their distribution in southern Africa. However, overgrazing from livestock farms leads to bush encroachment which reduces the habitat suitability for their normal prey items. The species is highly adaptable and reports of individuals utilising open agricultural areas suggests that the cats may respond to seasonal fluctuations of rodent populations associated with sowing and harvesting activities. However, given the unpredictable nature of these events, and associated risks due to the proximity to humans and their domestic carnivores, the benefit to resident cats is uncertain.  Also there is no research as to how these human-dominated landscapes are used by Black-footed cats and whether these specific records are due to the fact that they are exposed and highly frequented by human observers (A. Sliwa pers. obs.).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

However, it is subject to intense, uncontrolled poaching for its meat in most parts of its range. It is also threatened by loss of forest habitat in the south of its range. Bushmeat data collected along the Congo River suggest that very few of these monkeys have been sold at the markets during the past decade; implying that very few are left in the forest (Laudisoit, pers. obs. late 2010s). Black Mangabeys are large-bodied, and provide more meat per unit effort than the smaller guenons (Cercopithecus spp.) with which they share the habitat. They are, therefore, more attractive to hunters, especially if shotguns are used (a shotgun cartridge costs about US$1 in the region). Quantitatively, a recce survey between the two sectors of the Salonga National Park in 2009 (Maisels et al. 2009) showed that monkeys in general, and Black Mangabeys in particular, were very rare to the west of the park headquarters at Monkoto, and increasingly rare to absent at the western extreme (where the highest concentrations of people are located in the corridor). Overall encounter rate was 0.13 groups/km. A recce survey carried out at the same time and using the same survey method in the unprotected Sankuru Reserve (Liengola et al. 2010) recorded the species only 10 times in 400 km of survey effort – an encounter rate of only 0.025/km walked, and one-fifth of that recorded in the Salonga corridor, which was (and still is) at least partially protected by forest guards. In Salonga in 2016–2017, encounter rate of groups on transects varied between 0.2 (southern sector of the park) to 0.3 (northern sector) (Wildlife Conservation Society unpublished data 2016 and 2017, Ikati et al. 2017), so still an order of magnitude greater than encounter rates outside the park. It is likely that most unprotected forests in the range of this species are defaunated of the larger-bodied species, including Black Mangabeys. They had completely vanished from the Swa-Kabula Reserve in the southwest of the country before 1990 (Dino 2014). The same is likely to have occurred throughout their range, especially where human populations can travel freely and rapidly through the habitat (the case in savanna-forest mosaics south of the Kasai River). Rates of forest loss differ in the geographic ranges of the two subspecies. In the 130,000 km² range of L. a. opdenboschi, about 99,500 km² has forest cover (this area is the savanna-forest mosaic south of the Kasai River). A total of 3.7% of the forest cover that existed in 2001 was lost between 2001 and 2016 (GFW/WRI 2018). In L. a. aterrimus range, in the more closed-canopy continuous Congo Basin forests further north, the forest cover loss was only 2% during the same period – just over half of the rate of loss further south (of the subspecies' total range of 585,300 km²).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In those subpopulations inhabiting freshwater environments the high demand for water by human activities such agriculture, human use, etc. is altering watercourses through canalization and drainage and loss of riparian vegetation. These activities are promoted to increase the amount of agricultural lands but are impacting those otter subpopulations distributed in lowlands, particularly in the Central Valley and the Coastal Range of Chile (Medina-Vogel et al. 2003, Sepúlveda et al. 2009). In the case of Andean lakes, where the species occurred historically, the high level of urbanization and tourism has been proposed as the main causes responsible for the local extinction of the species in those areas (Medina 1996). Other threats are poaching (Medina 1996, Espinosa 2012), predation by free-ranging domestic dogs (Espinosa 2012) and transmission of diseases such as Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) (Sepúlveda et al. 2014). Free-ranging dogs are an important threat to carnivores because of predation and disease transmission (Vanak and Gompper 2009), and are present in rural and protected areas where the Southern River Otter occurs (Sepúlveda et al. 2014). Implementing dog population control measures as well as vaccination programmes are an important measure to mitigate the impact of dogs on this species (Sepúlveda et al. 2014). In several parts of the otter's distribution range, hydroelectric dams are installed or are planned to be built in the near future but no research on the potential impact of these on the otters has been conducted so far. The presence of wild exotic salmon and the salmon farming industry are suggested as a potential threat to otter prey leading to potential competition between otters and salmon (Medina 1996, Aued et al. 2003, Cassini et al. 2009) but no studies have confirmed this as yet. In relation to the invasive American Mink (Neovison vison), although several studies have investigated competition between these mustelids and river otters (Medina 1997, Aued et al. 2003, Fasola et al. 2009, Valenzuela et al. 2013), there is no clear evidence of a negative effect of the mink on the otter. Indeed, current studies in the marine part of the range suggest a negative effect of otters over minks by habitat (Valenzuela et al. 2013) and temporal segregation (Medina‐Vogel et al. 2013). The invasive mink is a potential vector of CDV to otters given their behavioural similarities and sharing of latrines (Sepúlveda et al. 2014).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

In most Asian countries although there has been increased human population during the last century, inadequate and ineffective rural development programmes have not been able to address the problems of poverty, forcing people to be more and more dependent on natural resources (Badola 1997). Consequently, most of the wetlands and waterways do not have adequate prey base for sustaining otter populations. Wetlands and waterways are polluted by eutrophication and accumulation of persistent pesticides such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and organophosphates through agricultural runoffs. Increased pesticide use is not only regarded as a major obstacle to the development of rice-fish culture, but also poses a danger to all predators feeding on aquatic prey in the area (Melisch et al. 1996). In the entire south and southeast Asia there is severe conflict between otters and humans, because of poverty and recent increase in aquaculture activities leading to indiscriminate killing of otters. Many important habitats of smooth otter have been lost to development activities. In southeast Asian countries, there does not seem to be any intentional otter trapping (Melisch et al. 1996) though it is prevalent in India, Nepal and Bangladesh.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

Habitat degradation resulting from overgrazing by livestock (a problem which is exacerbated by drought) is particularly likely to affect the long-term future of this species. Illegal live trade is also a serious problem. Additional threats include persecution, predation by feral dogs, inappropriate artificial feeding with sweet or salty foods by tourists and local inhabitants, and pollution of the wadis (rivers) associated with forests (E. van Lavieren pers. comm. 2006, F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007). The shooting of monkeys as a result of crop raiding and cedar bark stripping was reported by Deag (1977), but the current extent of this activity is unknown. Conflicts with local people have been reported in Algeria, as a result of crop-raiding by macaques (e.g., villages in Djurdjura National Park in the Grande-Kabylie region: F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007). The importance of different threats varies in different parts of the species' range; it is difficult to generalize. The destruction and degradation of the macaque’s forest habitat is the most serious threat to the species. Severe habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation have been caused by domestic and industrial consumption of wood, use of fire, clearing for cultivation and overgrazing by sheep and goat herds (Taub 1977, Fa 1984, Camperio Ciani 1986, Menard and Vallet, 1993). This is exacerbated by poor forestry management (often Cedrus atlanticus is favoured and efforts are made to reduce Quercus ilex, but the latter is a crucial resource for macaques: Ménard and Vallet, 1986, 1997).). Additionally, in recent years shepherds have increasingly settled near water sources. As shepherd tribes move into the forest, they often enclose open water sources with cement wells so they can extract water for their herds. As a result, macaques and other wildlife have been excluded from water sources in areas where it was previously accessible to them (Camperio Ciani et al. 2003).Live trade is also a significant threat to the wild M. sylvanus population. Most of the specimens taken from the wild are for the international pet trade. In comparison with the international trade, offtake for local purposes is relatively low, although M. sylvanus are kept fairly frequently as pets in Morocco (van Lavieren 2004) and local commercial use (remunerated photography in tourist areas and restaurants) has been reported in Algeria (F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007). M. sylvanus seems to be rarely used for food, except for some old reports in Algeria (Deag 1977). Reports of capture for the international pet trade date back to 1977 (Deag 1977), and since then the trade has increased markedly (van Lavieren 2004). Sanctuaries and zoos in Europe have become overstocked with Barbary Macaque infants offered to them by authorities and ex-owners, most infants coming straight from the wild (van Lavieren 2004). Infant M. sylvanus are offered openly and covertly for sale on markets all over Morocco, and prices of up to 200 Euro per animal have been recorded (van Lavieren 2004). Prices of about 100 Euros per animal have been recorded in Algeria, with Chaabet-el-Akhra gorges (Béjaïa) and Yakouren (Akfadou) being critical locations where illegal trade occur (F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007). It is estimated that up to 300 infants are taken annually from the Moroccan habitats (van Lavieren 2004). The maximum sustainable offtake of macaques in the Central Middle Atlas region has been estimated at between 200 and 250 individuals per year (van Lavieren 2004). If the estimate of 300 macaques taken annually from the wild is correct, then the offtake exceeds sustainability by up to 50% per year in this population.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Most remaining habitat for the species in its presumed Thai range is now effectively protected and many of the surviving forest blocks are large, in particular the Western Forest Complex. Therefore it seems unlikely that the species is in serious threat from either factor at the present there (but note the uncertainty over range and the identification of many records) (Anak Pattanavibool pers. comm. 2008, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). The apparent commonness of Fea’s Muntjac at low elevations in Kuiburi National Park, where hunting of this and Northern Red Muntjac occurs, suggests a similar degree of tolerance to hunting pressure as the later species, hunting was thought to have been relatively heavy in the past, enough to have significantly reduced all ungulate populations, although the initiation of protection measures appears to have turned the tide (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008, 2014). The species' use of lower elevations is imprecisely known, and may be related to climatic factors, thus if the species naturally occurred at relatively high densities in ‘wet’ lower forests, then the threat level faced by the species would be undoubtedly higher. Thus, even within the Western Forest Complex the ‘available habitat’ for Fea’s Muntjac would be concentrated at higher elevation, and in Thailand’s protected areas as a whole, land below ca. 400 m and areas of gentle terrain at higher elevations forms only a moderate fraction, ca. 30% of the total area (Chutipong et al. 2014, Wanlop Chutipong pers. comm. 2014).The Thanintharyi (= Tensasserim) region of Myanmar is currently relatively intact, but the ongoing and projected conversion of forests to oil palm plantation in southern Myanmar (Leimgruber et al. 2005) is some level of threat. Such conversion could destroy all large blocks of forest in the lowlands and adjacent lower hills, which includes some of the elevation range of the species. Forest and thus deer at higher elevations would probably remain secure. Altitudinal distribution of the species is too little understood to allow adequate assessment of this threat.It is thought that the forests of Tenasserim are much more heavily poached than adjacent Thai forests, and for instance poachers from Myanmar regularly cross the border into Kuiburi National Park, despite the fact that ungulate densities in Kuiburi National Park are already relatively low, thus suggesting that hunting intensity is much higher and ungulate densities now much lower in Myanmar (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2014). Hunting levels in the known Myanmar range can be assumed to be high (Than Thaw pers. comm. 2006).In the Taninthayi Nature Reserve (1,700 kmsq), in the northern Thanithayi Range, wildlife protection is limited despite the presence of park staff, and local professional hunters come in to the Nature Reserve to hunt a wide variety of species including muntjac. Local people adjacent to the area also use snares in the vicinity of their agricultural areas, and some also use home-made guns. Around 2005 a gas pipeline was constructed across the southern part of Taninthayi Nature Reserve. The pipeline, with a service track alongside it, is guarded by the army who have camps along it. The military personnel mainly rely on wildlife for their daily ration. The area affected is perhaps 15% of the Nature Reserve. Logging is also occurring, although on a small scale. In the southern Taninthayi range the situation is worse, largely because of the presence of many immigrant workers from central Myanmar, who have come to the area to work for oil palm and rubber plantations. These workers both set snares themselves and have also taught local communities these same snaring techniques. Hunting is much more openly practiced and is probably at least twice as worse as in the northern part of the range. The government is also still issuing licences to private timber companies for forest conversion to plantations, and already huge areas of land in the lowlands have been cleared to make way for oil palm and rubber plantations. There are two proposed protected areas in southern Taninthayi Range and one proposed protected area in the northern Taninthayi Range, none of which have any permanent staff (all Nay Myo Shwe pers. comm. 2014).In northern Myanmar (not confirmed to be within the species' range), muntjacs are commonly hunted, particularly for pelts (Than Thaw pers. comm. 2006). In Thailand, Fea’s Muntjac is apparently not specifically targeted by hunters, perhaps because of scarcity relative to M. vaginalis in many of the areas supporting most of the hunting, and in several especially eastern areas its primary range in higher elevations which are not visited frequently by hunters (Anak Pattanavibool pers. comm. 2008).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

Especially within Lao PDR and Viet Nam, there is indiscriminate snaring throughout its known range, for local meat consumption and a thriving bushmeat trade (see Timmins et al. 2007). However, the best protection from hunting at present is the ‘cushioning’ effect of large forest blocks, where the costs of extracting wildlife of low to medium commercial value from the centre are higher than the income from selling it, and where habitat is so extensive it is simply more difficult to hunt out cryptic, non-gregarious species, than it is in smaller forest blocks. Because most such blocks within the complex’s geographical range are centred on rugged terrain, with higher elevations forming the core of such areas, these muntjacs are likely to be significantly less threatened than are sympatric ground-dwelling mammals with altitudinal ranges limited to lower elevations. In localized areas, especially of northern Indochina, the species-complex is likely to be affected by habitat loss. Here, most ethnic groups practice shifting cultivation and in recent decades there has been a clear net loss and fragmentation of forest: such shifting cultivation is not now in a balanced cycle (for rotational systems), or never was (frontier systems). The adaptability of the species-complex to degraded or fragmented habitats is not well known, although evidence from northern Lao PDR suggests that animals there persist in landscape-scale mosaics including extensive secondary, degraded forest fragments and cultivation (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2006). In general it appears that muntjacs (particularly M. vaginalis and M. reevesi) adapt well to secondary and degraded habitats and in fact may reach higher densities in such areas than they do in unencroached habitats. More serious than losses to shifting cultivation, in the most recent years and the immediate future, is likely to be the large-scale replacement of natural forests (albeit mostly heavily degraded) with rubber plantations to supply the burgeoning Chinese market and other agro-industry plantations. This is affecting large areas of the northern highlands of Lao PDR and elsewhere, and will have three linked negative effects on ground-dwelling mammals: direct loss of habitat (it is unlikely that rubber plantations will support even mediocre densities of this species-complex, although this is not yet known), decline and destabilization of the forest resource-base (including wild-meat sources) for subsistence-level communities, leading to higher hunting levels in remaining wildlife areas (C. Wood pers. comm. 2005 to J.W. Duckworth, based on emerging patterns across several provinces in Lao PDR’s northern highlands); and shrinkage of the size of natural habitat blocks and thereby reduction and, locally, loss, of the cushioning effect.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

Handling of hibernating bats by researchers may result in the bats moving to the use of less suitable hibernacula, causing additional loss of fat reserves (Jones 1971 in Engel et al. 1976). In southern Indiana, Johnson et al. (1998) found that populations subject to high human visitation experienced increased weight loss in winter, but populations in each of two disturbed hibernacula increased in abundance, suggesting that ""M. sodalis is affected by limiting factors other than, or in addition to, human visitation in winter"". Vandalism and indiscriminate killing have been a problem at some caves. Commercialization of caves may result in excessive disturbance (Mohr 1972) or intentional elimination by cave owners (Hall 1962). Other threats include exclusion of bats by poorly designed gates (as formerly at Long's Cave in Mammoth Cave National Park, Kentucky), changes in cave temperatures induced by opening additional entrances (Matthews and Moseley 1990) or poorly designed barriers to human access (Richter et al. 1993). Improperly constructed gates can alter the air flow, trap debris, and block the entrance by not allowing enough flight space (Brady et al. 1982). Altered exchange of air with the outside environment can cause significant changes in cave temperature and humidity (Currie pers. comm., 1992) and may cause the bats to abandon the cave. Improperly constructed gates may also subject the bats to severe predation as they attempt to pass through the gates (Tuttle 1977). Despite protection at overwintering sites, populations continue to decrease in several portions of their range, suggesting that the species is being negatively affected by disturbance or loss of summer habitat. Loss and degradation of summer habitat and roost sites due to impoundment, stream channelization, housing development, clearcutting for agricultural use (Herkert 1992), or incompatible forest management practices that result in a shortage of the microhabitats used for maternity roosts may be the primary factors in recent population declines (Gardner pers. comm., 1992, Refsnider pers. comm. 1992, Currie pers. comm. 1992, see also Sparks et al. 2005, NatureServe 2016).The most recent threat to this and other cave bats is the white-nose syndrome caused by the fungus Geomyces destructans that affects hibernating individuals in caves through eastern United States (Thogmartin et al. 2012, Powers et al. 2015).  White-nose syndrome is having an appreciable influence on the status and trends of Indiana bat populations, stalling and in some cases reversing population gains made in recent years.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

However, by September 2005 the high volume of good-quality water entering the marshes from the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, a result of two record years of snowpack melt in Turkey and Iran, allowed 39% of the former marshes to be reflooded (Richardson and Hussain 2006). Although reflooding does not guarantee restoration success, field surveys found a remarkable rate of re-establishment of native macroinvertebrates, macrophytes, fish, and birds in reflooded marshes (Richardson and Hussain 2006). However, the future availability of water for restoration is in question, which suggests that only a portion of the former marshes may be restored (Richardson and Hussain 2006). Also, landscape connectivity between marshes is greatly reduced, causing concern about local species extinctions and lower diversity in isolated wetlands (Richardson and Hussain 2006).

Fox predation of small rodents occurs but impact unquantified. Construction of fences and other elevated structures provides perches for predatory birds (P. Canty pers. comm).Habitat degradation (including trampling of burrows) and resource depletion by livestock and feral herbivores (moderate, most of range) represent another threat: excessive trampling by domestic and feral ungulates can severely degrade the vegetated patches of sand in which this species burrows; this leads to de-stabilisation of these areas making them prone to wind and water erosion (Canty and Brandle 2008); higher stocking rates for sheep and cattle prior to 1950 may have been a significant factor in their historical decline; placement of artificial water points in areas of prime habitat may be a continuing threat to some populations.At least road construction (minor, minor part of range): roads tend to traverse gibber pavement and road building material is harvested from gibbers (P.

Large tracts of mature boreal forest have been felled and replaced by a managed forest landscape that is a mosaic of semi-natural forest, young saplings, and clear-cut patches. Fragmentation of forests is a particular problem for this species, as flying squirrels are reluctant to cross open areas on the ground. Managed forests also tend to have fewer deciduous trees (which are an essential winter food source), less decaying wood and fewer tree-holes (which are needed for nest-sites). In parts of Russia, it has been estimated that up to 50% of logging is illegal (Kotlobay and Ptichnikov 2002). Illegal logging is particularly destructive, as unsustainable practices such as high-grading or 'skimming' are used, meaning that for every ten trees felled only one or two high-quality logs will be used (Kotlobay and Ptichnikov 2002).

Pallas’s Cat has several known and tested causes of vulnerability, including feeding and habitat specialization, large range sizes, dependency on shelters made by other threatened species (marmots), and vulnerability to pastoralist activities which are ubiquitous throughout its range (high associated mortality and displacement by herding activities).The most serious threat to Pallas’s Cat is habitat degradation and fragmentation. Degradation is occurring through increased human population size and expansion of animal husbandry across the species range (Barashkova et al. 2007, Damdinsuren et. al. 2008, Huanguang and van Veen 2014). In Mongolia livestock numbers have increased from 33 million in 1999 to 45 million in 2013, with a forecast annual increase of 10.2% (National Statistical Office of Mongolia 2013). As well as habitat degradation, with livestock come domestic herding dogs which are known to be an important predator of Pallas’s Cat (Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Farhadinia et al. 2012, Ross et al. 2012, Joolaee et al. 2014). Across the region other sources of habitat fragmentation include infrastructural developments, development of the mining industry (Awehali 2011, Paltsyn et al. 2012, Selles 2013), and the petrochemical industry in China (Abdukadir 1997). Due to habitat loss it is very likely that Pallas’s Cat populations are becoming increasingly fragmented and isolated. In Russia, there is believed to be a risk of loss of isolated subpopulations, particularly in Buryatia Republic (A. Barashkova pers. comm. 2014).Another serious threat is depletion of their prey base through poisoning and over-hunting. Pikas and rodents have been targeted as pests by poisoning campaigns in China and Mongolia because they are believed to compete for forage that could otherwise be utilised by livestock, contribute to grassland degradation, and can serve as vectors for the plague (Clark et al. 2006, Smith and Xie 2008, Delibes-Mateos et al. 2011; Harris et al. 2014). Pika make up the majority of Pallas’s Cat diet and are extremely important for the species persistence (Ross et al. 2010b). Poisoning continues in China where pika populations have been reduced to less than 5% of pre-control densities (Lai and Smith 2003). In Mongolia poison bait campaigns to control small mammal numbers have occurred in all provinces (Clark et al. 2006, Winters 2006) and are continuing. Control of rodents in Russia is also on-going but only at small localized scales which are currently not expected to threaten the species (Shilova and Tchabovsky 2009, A. Barashkova pers. comm. 2014).Due to sympatric predation the Pallas’s Cat has a dependency on marmot burrows and rock cavities, particularly for raising young (Ross et al. 2010a). Most marmot species remain non-threatened but the Siberian Marmot which overlaps Pallas’s Cat’s range in Russia and Mongolia has declined due to overharvesting and is now classified as Endangered (Batbold et al. 2008). The decline of this species may result in the loss of keystone resources for the Pallas’s Cat and other steppe species (Ross et al. 2010a).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Causes of this destruction include human settlement, forest transformation to plantations, draining for agriculture, pollution, and excessive hunting, wood-cutting and fishing. In addition, clearance of coastal mangroves over the past decade has been rapid in Tropical Asia. The depletion of fish stocks from over-fishing is prevalent in many Asian wetland environments and is likely to be a significant threat. Expansion of oil palm plantations is currently viewed as the most urgent threat (Wilting et al. 2010). Trapping, snaring and poisoning are also threats: E. Bennett (in Sunquist and Sunquist 2002) reported that skins were frequently seen in longhouses in the interior of Sarawak, and the Flat-headed Cat has been captured in traps set out to protect domestic fowl (Nowell and Jackson 1996).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

The total extent of prime habitat of the Rusty-spotted Cat in India and Nepal is equivalent to around 25% of the range of the species in these countries. These are perhaps the only areas where populations of the species are likely to persist in the future. This translates to 75% of the current habitat in India and Nepal facing an imminent danger of conversion to urban areas, industry, mining and other forms of land use hostile to Rusty-spotted Cat (Bhardwaj and Dutta 2014, Mazoomdaar 2015 a,b). Apart from agriculture and industry, parts of the Central Indian landscape within the range of the species is rapidly being converted for establishing solar plants as an alternative source of generating energy during the past few years (Sharma 2015). Since the climate summit of 2015, this is bound to increase given India’s strong commitment to reduce its carbon footprint. Categorization of certain portions of the species’s habitat (scrub, degraded forest) as wasteland facilitates such conversion (Mukherjee and Koparde in prep.). As much of the distributional range constitutes marginal habitat for the species, this 75% loss of habitat could translate to a decline of around 20-25% (assuming 70-80% of the population resides in prime habitat and a relatively direct relationship between loss of habitat and loss of mature individuals) of the current population over three generations. Given the much smaller landmass of Sri Lanka, the mainland population constitutes perhaps 90% or a little more of the global populationSince much of the species’s range is within hugely human-dominated areas undergoing rapid land use change, fragmentation of habitat and disease should be considered as serious threats. There are concerns regarding possible hybridization of Rusty-spotted Cat with domestic cats (Kittle and Watson 2004) but these have yet to be substantiated and measured to determine if this factor is indeed a threat to the species. There is a belief that Rusty-spotted Cats do not get into conflict, unlike Jungle Cats, since they are believed not to prey on poultry (Manakadan and Sivakumar 2006). However, this needs to be backed by research and the threats need to be evaluated across the species’s global distribution. Reflecting the uncertainty of this assessment, the species should be prioritised for research and monitoring.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In spite of these efforts Przewalski’s Gazelle is still threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, barriers to movement, intensified competition with domestic livestock and increasing predation (Li et al. 2012). These threats are amplified by human expansion and excessive livestock grazing (there are ca2.9 million livestock around Qinghai Lake; Qi 2009), which have caused the deterioration of nearly all grasslands in the region (Liu et al. 2004, Sun et al. 2007).Populations are fragmented and isolated, with limited movement between them owing to geographic (mountains, lakes, deserts) and anthropogenic (railways, roads, human settlement, pastureland) barriers (Li et al. 2013).Hunting has not been a key threat following the extensive confiscation of guns by the government in the 1990s (Harris 2008). However predation has become one of the most serious threats to the survival of Przewalski’s Gazelle because of the growth of the wolf (Canis lupus) population around Qinghai Lake (Jiang et al. 2000, Jiang and Wang 2001). Predation on the physically drained adult males in the rutting season, lambing females and calves significantly affects growth of the gazelle population (Jiang 2004, 2008).Gazelles on the eastern shore of Qinghai Lake (where the majority of the population exists) have been fenced out of their main feeding grounds since 1994 (Jiang et al. 2000) and most of their habitat has already been lost to the increasing human population, farming activities, and desertification.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

This translates into, at minimum, an equivalent loss of range for the Golden Cat as a result of habitat loss and fragmentation. Prior to the year 2000, West and East Africa had already suffered an 88-92% reduction in rainforest, while Central Africa’s rainforest extent was reduced by 40% (Laurance et al. 2006).Intensive hunting for bushmeat (>1 million tonnes per year harvested in the Congo Basin, the species’ main stronghold; Wilkie and Carpenter 1999), leading to ‘empty forest syndrome’ (Sayer 1992), likely accounts for greater reduction in area of occupancy (AOO) for the Golden Cat than deforestation, but is more difficult to quantify. Within 10–15 km of roads and settlements, large and medium bodied mammals experience sharp declines in population (Laurance et al. 2006, Blake et al. 2007, Henschel 2008). In excess of 64% of forest habitat in the Congo Basin lies within 10 km of a road and is also predicted to be affected by higher hunting pressure (Blake et al. 2007). Development of roads increased rapidly in the past 15 years (e.g. 35% increase in the Democratic Republic of Congo and >300% increase in northern Republic of Congo since the year 2000; Laporte et al. 2007). Golden Cat populations within these highly impacted areas are likely to be severely reduced or extirpated through direct mortality and loss of prey.Golden cats are often not a primary target species, but are frequently killed by wire-snares (four individuals in two months in 20 km2 in Gabon; Bahaa-el-din pers. obs.; and 13 individuals in three months in Lobéké, Cameroon; Ray et al. 2005), probably owing to similarities in body size and trail use to target species such as duikers. In an area of moderate bushmeat hunting, Golden Cats were recorded at less than a quarter of the population densities that they are found at in pristine areas (Bahaa-el-din et al. in prep). Where more intense hunting occurs, such as in village hunting areas (e.g. Dibouka village in central Gabon; Henschel 2008) and national parks (e.g. Korup NP in southwest Cameroon; TEAM, http://www.teamnetwork.org), camera trap and bushmeat studies did not record the species despite the presence of suitable habitat contiguous with the main forest of the Congo Basin.Recent landscape-scale Golden Cat surveys in mainland Equatorial Guinea (Rio Muni) emphasize that prior range estimates based on forest cover may have significantly overestimated remaining golden cat range. An estimated 78% of Rio Muni consists of tropical dense forest and therefore putatively suitable habitat, but Golden Cats were found to occupy just 16% of the area (Martinez Marti 2011). Its presence in the area was correlated with rugged, inaccessible terrain away from human disturbance (Martinez Marti 2011). Golden Cats were reported by locals to be easy to hunt and locally extirpated long before other medium-to-large mammal species (Martinez Marti 2011).These threats will intensify, as the human population within the species’ range shows the fastest growth rates in the world (+2.6-2.8% per annum for West, Central and East Africa; FAO 2011). The population in main Golden Cat range countries, estimated at nearly a quarter of a billion for 2013, is projected to almost quadruple by 2100 (UN 2012, http://esa.un.org/wpp/).The current “stampede of foreign investment” in mining activities and associated infrastructure development in Africa is of immediate concern (Edwards et al. 2014). In Central Africa, 42% of ecologically important areas would be directly impacted if there were complete development of mineral resources in the region (assuming that ecological impacts extend within 10 km of mines; Edwards et al. 2014). China’s mineral investment alone has quadrupled in 10 years (Zhang 2011). In addition, it is predicted that the conversion of forests to oil palm plantations, which has caused extensive loss of forest habitat and biodiversity in Southeast Asia, will have similar impacts in Africa (particularly in West and Central Africa) as it expands over the coming years (Wich et al. 2014). The realisation of these investments includes habitat destruction and degradation, relocation of human populations into previously remote areas and massive-scale infrastructural development including road and rail which in turn lead to the aforementioned surge in bushmeat hunting in these areas (Edwards et al. 2014).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The declines are corroborated by local villagers across the area, who consistently report major reductions from former abundances, in the past few decades.The greatest threat to Saola is hunting. While wildlife in the Saola's range are most threatened mainly by commercial hunting for the bushmeat and traditional medicine trades, specific demand for Saola is almost non-existent, because the species is unknown in the traditional Chinese pharmacopoeia (nor is its meat considered to be particularly tastier than muntjacs or Sambar). Instead, the animal is snared incidentally in the intense, general pursuit primarily of other species valued in the region’s wildlife trade.The intensity of hunting in the Saola's range is hard to adequately describe, but some figures hint at the enormity of the problem. The human population of Vietnam is more than 90 million, that of China more than a billion. Together, they comprise an enormous market for wildlife products. For example, tens of millions of wild turtles are imported, legally and illegally, into China annually (van Dijk et al. 2000 and papers therein). Mammals valued in traditional Asian medicine, such as bears, Tigers and Sambar, are all hunted intensively in the Saola's range with snares, guns and dogs - all methods which are also effective at killing Saolas.Although hunting for the bushmeat trade may be somewhat more localized than trade in medicinal animals (because of logistical issues of transportation before meat can spoil), its intensity is similar if not higher, because animals such as muntjacs and civets are relatively resilient to hunting and remain widespread. Probably close to ten million Vietnamese, i.e., ten million people with the propensity to eat wildlife, live within 100 km of forest inhabited by Saola. It is unlikely that any Saolas occur more than 35 km from a village. The bushmeat trade has little likelihood of abating as long as there are pigs, muntjacs, and civets to be hunted, but Saola will become extinct long before these more common species are hunted out. In Vietnam, informal interviews with hunters in Pu Huong Nature Reserve revealed that 30 Saola were killed there between 1995 and 2003 (Hoang Xuan Quang and Cao Tien Trung 2004). In some local villages in Vietnam, hunters used to kill three individuals per year 10 years ago, but now rarely catch any (Do Tuoc and Alexei Abramov pers. comm. 2006). Additionally, thousands of collectors of turtles, pangolins, rosewood, agarwood and other forest products comb every square kilometre of Saola range on a yearly basis, opportunistically hunting and setting snares for subsistence bushmeat and additional opportunistic income.Although specific trade demand for Saola has been low, it could be increasing as the species grows rarer, and disposable incomes in the region expand.With Saola populations now so low, local hunting for subsistence also poses a risk. Saola may be particularly susceptible to being hunted with dogs (Robichaud 1998). The pressure from proximal human settlements is so intense that there are no longer core areas in the Saola's range not regularly reached by hunters. It is likely that in 80% or more of forest within the Saola’s range, every year snares capable of catching Saolas are are set in every square kilometre. In some areas (possibly approaching 50% of potential Saola range) intensity probably reaches many thousands of snare-days per square kilometre per year.Snaring is less intensive in Laos, but there the majority of Saola range lies along the Vietnam border, and is heavily hunted by transborder Vietnamese poachers, and/or coincides with the distribution of the ethnic Hmong in Laos, who avidly and effectively hunt a wide range of wildlife, including Saola. These forests are nearly as devoid of large mammals as forests in Vietnam.Habitat destruction is also a threat to the species. Forests in the Saola’s range are destroyed or degraded for small-scale agriculture, commercial agriculture, timber extraction, roads, mining and hydro-power development. Although, there is presently more Saola habitat than there are Saolas, the human population growth rate in the Saola's range (both from in-migration and births) is high, which will intensify habitat lost in the coming years.Presumably, the generation time of Saola is greater than three years, and reproductive output is lower than that of muntjacs, serows or Sambar, putting Saola at a conservation disadvantage. Additionally, pigs, serows, muntjacs and Sambar retain significant population reservoirs in areas of lower hunting pressure, such as difficult-to-reach areas of secondary forest, higher altitude forests and/or extensive blocks of monsoonal forest in Laos, but Saola does not. The apparent absence of Saola from extensive areas of secondary forest is either an indication of a greatly accelerated rate of decline compared with other species, or an ecological intolerance, neither of which bodes well for the species.Economic development and expanding wealth in the region are increasing the demand for wildlife medicines and bushmeat. Development projects in the region commonly cite poverty as a principal cause of biodiversity loss, but the main threat in the Saola's range, at least for the mid-term, is increasing wealth in its range countries and in China. Wealth, not poverty, is the principal driver of the region’s wildlife trade.The recent construction through the Annamite Mountains in Vietnam of the Ho Chi Minh Road, parallel to and with branches to the Lao border, affects Saola subpopulations by forest fragmentation and increased human access for hunting and the rapid transportation of wildlife to urban markets. It has also led to increased forest clearance in several critical areas, especially the Hue Saola Nature Reserve and Quang Nam Saola Reserve, as well as areas in Quang Binh and Quang Tri Provinces. The transboundary feeder roads from the Ho Chi Minh Road into Laos are likely negatively affecting Saola in all provinces where the species occurs in Laos.Saolas have proved difficult (thus far impossible) to maintain in captivity (Robichaud 1998), although no efforts involving appropriate expertise and care have yet been made (Robichaud and Long in press). Approximately twenty Saolas, at least, have been captured in Vietnam and Laos since the species was described in 1993. All died soon afterwards, with exception of two released back into the wild shortly after their capture (Stone 2006).Protected area management has been largely ineffective in the Saola's range. In a few areas the situation is beginning to change, but to-date protected areas have offered little or no refuge for the species. Most protected in the Saola’s range have proved particularly impotent in the control of poaching. Some have done better at safeguarding areas from economic development, but protected areas in the region are still commonly sites of hydro-power projects, road construction, and mining.Lastly there are the threats arising intrinsically from small population size, including, but certainly not limited to, the possibility that individual Saolas may now be largely isolated from one another for breeding (Saola Working Group 2009, Robichaud and Long 2014).In summary, intense hunting and a multitude of exacerbating pressures on Saola are increasing, and evidence indicates that the species, which is naturally uncommon and localized, is in a major decline. Without concerted action and change, the trend is likely to result in the extinction of Saola in the foreseeable future.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Because of the deforestation of this forest buffer, any remaining patches of forest (and their roosting bats), were more susceptible to tropical cyclones. These cyclones can cause significant fluctuations in bat population size and, along with shortage of food and dehydration, and they are now the major current threat to the species (Powell and Wehnelt 2003).In the past the species was also hunted for food, however, this is now rare (Trewhellaet al. 2005, Price 2013). Due to its habit of raiding fruit trees (mangoes, lychees, papaya etc), there is a human-wildlife conflict (Barnes 2013, Price 2013). A new law has been passed for the Republic of Mauritius: the Native Terrestrial Biodiversity and National Parks Act (2015). Whilst the Rodrigues Fruit Bat is still protected under this law, it has provisions for declaring any species as a ‘pest’ and may allow culling of the species (in spite of it being a threatened species). An official cull of nearly 31,000 Mauritius Fruit Bat Pteropus niger was sanctioned in 2015. Whilst the law still protects the Rodrigues Fruit Bat, there are now provisions and a precedent for culling. However, the Rodrigues Regional Assembly is an autonomous administration under the Republic of Mauritius and has the right under the Rodrigues Regional Assembly Act (2001) to pass its own laws and regulations.Rodrigues is an island that has shown very proactive environmental and conservation initiatives (e.g., banning of plastic bags, closure season for octopus fishing, green job creation, recycling etc.) and it is unlikely to sanction culling of bats in the near future.

The use of organochlorine pesticides is believed to have contributed to the earlier dramatic decline of the species in France (Brosset et al. 1988). In North Africa, threats include habitat loss due to agriculture (livestock) and human disturbance.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Approximately 17% of mainland Kabupaten Kupang was classified as forest in 2006 with the majority found on upper slopes (250-550 m) and moderate inclines (Fisher 2012).

There is an increase in habitat disturbance from humans in the southern sectors of the Na Hang Nature Reserve. They are not shy and do not necessarily flee when encountered by humans, increasing the chance of being shot (Nguyen 2000). Hunting is the most immediate threat to this species (Nadler et al. 2003), despite claims from various sources that it is not hunted. The only reason more individuals are not shot is due to the rarity of the species, and not because of law enforcement or awareness of the species importance (Long and Le Khac Quyet 2001).Although this species is not usually targeted for bushmeat hunting due to its ""foul-taste"", it is shot when encountered, and consumed or used in traditional ""medicine"" (Le and Boonratana 2006; Nadler et al. 2003). It has been found in trade in China, where it may be used for ""medicinal"" purposes (Nadler pers. comm.), although this is likely to be limited. There is a high hunting pressure in the area where it lives, as evidenced by several gunshots heard almost daily during field trips (2004-2005) in the Na Hang Nature Reserve (Le and Boonratana 2006). Shifting and settled cultivation, as well as other land development activities, also pose a threat (Le and Boonratana 2006; Nadler et al. 2003). In the past, excessively intense and unsustainable legal and illegal logging and gold mining were the biggest threats. Recently, the development of a hydroelectric power project along the Gam River in Na Hang has caused large areas of its habitat to come under construction (Le and Boonratana 2006; Nadler et al. 2003). Also, sudden increases in human populations, especially construction workers, have led to increased demand for meat, and thus increased hunting pressure (Le and Boonratana 2006).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

There is currently construction and development for tourism, including a tourist road, cable car and hotels within the nature reserve, which are a potential threat because of habitat destruction and disturbance.

(2005) suggested that Rousettus madagascariensis  is not dependent on relatively intact forest, the extent to which the  destruction and degradation of natural forest threatens this species is  not clear. Recent research demonstrated that the removal of forest cover  in the east led the bats to abandon their roosts (Andrianaivoarivelo et al.  2011a). Some colonies are located away from intact forest and  additional study is therefore needed on the mobility of this species.  The main threats to R. madagascariensis are to its roosts where it is  subject to hunting pressure (Golden 2005, 2009; Jenkins et al.  2007; Rakotonandrasana and Goodman 2007; Jenkins and Racey 2008) in  virtually all sites that are not inside protected areas (Goodman et al.  2005) or considered sacred (Rakotoarivelo and Randrianandriananina  2007). It appears to be hunted exclusively for subsistence and bats are  harvested using locally made traps as well as being knocked down from  the cave ceiling with wooden batons (Andrianaivoarivelo et al.  2011a, Rakotonandrasana and Goodman 2007).

Selective hunting of young males and subsequent distortion of the sex ratio has also affected reproduction by heavily skewing the sex ratio (Milner-Gulland et al. 2003). A second significant threat is the destruction of key habitats and traditional migration routes. The recent increase in steppe fires is a further cause for concern. Extreme climatic events, pose a threat, drought in summer and severe winters, especially heavy snow or ‘dzuud’ or ‘dzut’ conditions when an ice-crust forms on top of snow and impedes access to forage. Several resulting instances of mass-mortality are known, such as the winter of 1953/54 in Kazakhstan when 80,000 animals died (Heptner et al. 1961).Saiga are susceptible to several diseases, including foot-and-mouth disease, brucellosis and others, which may also cause large numbers of deaths. There have been four recent mass-mortality events (MME). In 2010, around two-thirds of a calving aggregation of 20,000 in the Ural population died of a peracute respiratory disease with bloat, and this was followed in 2011 by a smaller die-off of several hundreds of Saiga with similar clinical signs, immediately after calving, and grazing in the exact same location as the earlier MME, suggesting a site-specific cause. Pasteurellosis was implicated based on clinical signs and bacteriology, but very little pathology was undertaken (Kock et al. 2018).In 2015, more than 200,000 Saiga died within three weeks in central Kazakhstan. The proximate cause of death, based on multiple strands of evidence, was confirmed as haemorrhagic septicaemia caused by the bacterium Pasteurella multocida type B (Kock et al. 2018). Statistical modelling suggests that there was unusually high relative humidity and temperature in the days leading up to the outbreak; temperature and humidity anomalies were also observed in two previous similar events in the same region. The modelled influence of environmental covariates is consistent with known drivers of haemorrhagic septicemia. Given the Saiga population’s vulnerability to mass mortality and the likely exacerbation of climate-related and environmental stressors in the future, management of risks to population viability, such as poaching and viral livestock disease, is urgently needed, as well as robust ongoing veterinary surveillance (Kock et al. 2018).On 22nd December 2016 the first death of a Mongolian Saiga (S. t. mongolica) was reported by herders to the local authorities in Darvi Soum in the Khuisiin Gobi. Hundreds of live and dead Saiga were subsequently observed with a PPR-like syndrome and signs. Samples were confirmed at the Mongolia State Central Veterinary Laboratory (SCVL) on 6th January 2017 to contain PPR virus and gene sequencing confirmed the virus to be of high similarity to the virus recorded in sheep and goats. The Saiga infection developed rapidly into a full-blown epidemic and by the end of January; death and infection were reported across most of the Saiga range (Kock 2017). Based on carcass counts, over 54% of the population is estimated to have died.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Neyman (1978) estimated that 75% of the original distribution of S. oedipus had been cleared for agriculture and pasture, and that the remainder of its range was represented by small isolated forest patches along with its main stronghold, the Paramillo National Natural Park of 460,000 ha. Cerquera (1985) reported on the threats regarding the construction of two hydroelectric dams, Urra I and Urra II, on the Ríos Sinu and San Jorge, in the south of its range. Urra II is sited within the Paramillo National Natural Park and is expected to flood more than 54,000 ha of primary and secondary forest, within what is considered to be the last major stronghold for the species.The three protected areas where they occur have lost a significant portion of their forests (Barbosa et al. 1988). Paramillo has lost approximately 42% of its original forested habitat and Montes de Maria and Los Colorados lost 70 and 71%, respectively. To date, almost 200,000 ha of the original forested areas within protected boundaries of the parks and reserves dedicated to Cotton-top Tamarin conservation efforts have been lost. This suggests, therefore, that there is less than 2,600 km² that will be protected in perpetuity for Cotton-top Tamarins by the Colombian Ministerio del Medio Ambiente. Although these areas are protected, they continue to suffer from the pressure of the growing local populations to extract resources or clear areas for agricultural activities.Defler (1994, 2004; pp.196-201) discusses the conservation status and threats to this species (see also Defler and Rodríguez-Mahecha 2003, Defler et al. 2003).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Both of these groups may also sell any surplus meat which usually commands at least twice the price of domestic pork in local markets and speciality restaurants. Efforts to reduce or discourage hunting are unfortunately also often compromised by generally negative attitudes towards these animals, which can cause severe damage to crops planted within or close to existing forest boundaries, and which are therefore regarded as pests and, hence, a legitimate target for hunting activities (Oliver et al. 1993). Unfortunately, this species is also threatened by genetic contamination via hybridization with free-ranging domestic and feral animals of ex-Sus scrofa origin, and hybrids have been confirmed from almost all remaining population sites (Blouch 1995; Oliver 1995, 2001).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In Assam, as elsewhere, most former habitat has been lost to settlements and agriculture following the rapid expansion of the human population (Oliver 1980, 1981, 1989; Oliver and Deb Roy 1993). Some management practices, such as planting of trees in the grasslands and indiscriminate use of fire to create openings and to promote fresh growth of grass, have caused extensive damage to the habitats the authorities intend to protect (Narayan and Deka 2002). A combination of these factors has almost certainly resulted in the loss of all of the small populations of these animals in the reserve forests of north-western Assam. These losses strongly reinforced the overwhelming importance of the largest and, by the early to mid-1980s, only known surviving population in the Manas (Oliver 1981, 1989; Oliver and Deb Roy 1993).Hunting for wild meat by tribes was not considered a major problem in the past but is now threatening the remnant populations (Narayan and Deka 2002). The survival of Pygmy Hogs is closely linked to the existence of the tall, wet grasslands of the region which, besides being a highly threatened habitat itself, is also crucial for survival of a number endangered species such as Indian Rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis), Tiger (Panthera tigris), Swamp Deer (Cervus duvauceli), Wild Buffalo (Bubalus arnee), Hispid Hare (Caprolagus hispidus), Bengal Florican (Eupodotis bengalensis), Swamp Francolin (Francolinus gularis) and some rare turtles and terrapins.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

During several camera-trap studies in the paramo, high elevation grasslands and cloud forests of the Chirropo massif, the species was found to be relatively abundant throughout the region based on photographic evidence and scats (Schipper pers. comm.).  However, interviews with locals in the area suggest that the species was previously more common than it is today, and likely had a larger distribution that extended down to lower elevations (which have since been converted to cattle pasture and other agriculture).  The following are potential threats for S. dicei in the Talamanca mountain region of Costa Rica (Schipper pers. comm.):1. Coyotes - a non-native carnivore (natural range expansion south following cattle) and is likely the greatest consumer of S. dicei in the Talamancans.  Probably less of a threat in forested areas, but in paramo and grassland their bones are in nearly every scat found.2. Fire - lower elevations of Talamanca are burned annually for range control, but the paramos burn periodically and completely over large areas (also human caused - accidental and intentional).  This likely has a short term effect by removing forage and a longer term effect by removing hiding places.3. Habitat loss - coupled with fire is the reduction of forest habitat along the lower reaches of the species' range.  This has the effect of range contraction, as it is already limited entirely to the Montane forest areas, which are being logged and cleared for pasture right up to the park border.4. Mesocarnivore population explosions - along the contact zone with S. dicei and humans there is intensive hunting of large mammal fauna, which has the indirect effect of increasing the number of mesocarnivores (coyotes, tayra, and other rabbit predators).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Hunting is prohibited in the Abhaya Rubber Plantation, yet electrocution from power lines and hunting by dogs are local threats, which are affecting the population (Medhi et al. 2004). A comparative analysis based on satellite images taken in 1988 and 1998 showed a 50% loss of original habitat in India for this species (Srivastava et al. 2001). Although commercial logging is banned in reserves where this species is found, illegal encroachment and woodcutting have severely affected these forest reserves (Srivastava et al. 2001). Stone quarrying and its associated noise pollution, as well as artillery firing practices in the Bamuni hills, may also have a negative effect.Molur et al. (2003) list the following threats for this species: “Crop plantations, grazing, harvesting non-woody vegetation for firewood and charcoal production, selective logging, timber collection, human settlement, deforestation, fragmentation, trade, killed by domestic dogs, habitat loss, high juvenile mortality, inbreeding, and local trade in live animals as pets and in road shows. Trade is insignificant.” Due to road construction and other human activities (settlements), the northern and southern populations are completely separated and this has led to loss of suitable habitats and fragmentation (J. Das pers. comm.). There are potential threats to the population in the near future in India due to mustard cultivation and other human activities, and therefore the population is also expected to decline (J.

The decline of Mountain Bongo populations in the Aberdares in recent years has been attributed to increased hunting by local people and habitat loss, and even to the increased numbers of Lion in the area (Elkan and Smith 2013). Although these factors have no doubt contributed to the decline of Mountain Bongo, the impact of disease has probably been underestimated: the grazing of cattle in the forest reserves of Mount Kenya and the Aberdares as high as the Hagenia forest on the Aberdares plateau may have greater implications for Bongo conservation than hunting pressure in terms of disease transmission (L. Estes pers. comm. in Elkan and Smith 2013).

In either case, many areas of potentially suitable habitat persist. Thus, habitat factors alone are unlikely to have been an unlikely driver of of its present extreme rarity. There may be significant loss of natural and semi-natural habitat over the next decade with many hydro-power projects being proposed in the region. Cashew plantations, which might hold most of the surviving populations of this species, are threatened by large-scale clearance (Ashraf et al. 1993).   The use of civet-musk is said to have been widespread within this species's range during 1965-1970 (Ashraf et al. 1993). In the past, this species might have been used to collect civet oil, although there are no records to authenticate this claim. Small Indian Civet is still illegally ‘farmed’ and kept in captivity to extract civet, and any remaining Malabar Civets are likely to be at risk for the same reason. Villagers report retaliatory killings of civets, taken by the interviewers to include Malabar Civet, for raiding poultry – although there is no hard evidence this species is killed for this reason. Once again it might be a case of mistaken identity between Malabar Civet and Small Indian Civet or even Common Palm Civet. The most recent skins apparently came from outside protected areas, suggesting that hunting is likely to remain a threat to this already rare species (Ashraf et al 1993). There are a few protected areas in the lowland of Kerala, but whether the species inhabits them is unknown. This species is not selectively hunted, but 10 of 22 reports of animals assessed by Ashraf et al. (1990) to relate to this species and made during 1950 to 1990 were caught by dogs; there is no evidence that these reports actually relate even in part to Malabar Civet. Whatever the proportion of report of retaliatory killing and hunting that truly relate to Malabar Civet, that these practices occur in the species's presumed range means that they are likely to threaten any remaining Malabar Civets.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

These threats lead to forest fragmentation and soil loss/erosion. Specifically, a decrease in habitat quality has been due to the loss of fruiting trees and sleeping sites through monocultures and plantations, selective felling, and a subsequent increase in the canopy gaps. These animals are hunted and traded for food, sport and traditional “medicine”, and accidental mortality due to trapping occurs. There is a local trade for bones, meat for food and the live animals as pets (Molur et al. 2003). Habitat loss and poaching are the major threats in India and Bangladesh. There has been a reduction in forest in Assam by over 10% in two years between 2001 and 2003 (Forest Survey of India 2003).In Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia, hunting for food and trade is the primary threat, but as a predominantly lowland species habitat loss likely is also a major threat to the species.  In Thailand, the males of this species are exploited for picking coconuts by the industry.  Sometimes, a well-trained macaque is sold for 1,000USD. They are also in demand by resorts for show (R. Boonratana pers. comm.).In Myanmar, hunting, trade, habitat loss in varying degrees, shifting cultivation in the north, logging in the east and south, and rubber plantations are the major threats (S.

Peruvian ministry reports and GCF data suggest a slightly higher annual forest loss rate (210 km²/year) for San Martin Province, the core of this species range, over the period 2010-2017. These data would seem to suggest that the loss of nearly all remaining unprotected habitat within this species’ range is possible if current rates of deforestation continue to the year 2030.In addition, L. flavicauda is heavily hunted by indigenous communities, market hunters and in retaliation for crop damage. Infants are also routinely taken as pets when mothers are killed (DeLuycker and Heymann 2007, Shanee 2012).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

It has the smallest range of the genus, which coincides with the most densely populated part of Brazilian Amazonia, a region with a long tradition of colonization, and which now has deforestation levels that begin to rival those of the Atlantic Forest. Over the last few decades, the establishment of highways, implantation of the Tucuruí hydroelectric dam, logging, and agricultural and ranching activities have lead to widespread devastation of forested areas in this region. The proliferation of secondary roads has further exacerbated this process. Chiropotes satanas is already locally extinct in a large part of its original range and what remains is extremely fragmented and under constant deforestation pressure. Despite not being particularly lucrative or an easy target, this species is also hunted for its meat and fur. Habitat fragmentation processes are probably increasing hunting pressure on this species by providing easier access and through the loss of preferred game. Although this species is more tolerant of habitat fragmentation than previously thought, this should not be considered a motive for complacency with regard to the importance of the implementation of conservation measures, particularly the establishment and adequate control of protected areas. In addition, small populations living in isolated fragments with few opportunities for dispersal are probably not genetically viable in the long-term.

Snaring operations range from the setting of a few snares to supply the camps of forest users not targeting ground-dwelling large mammals, to well-organised gangs focused on supplying such mammals to the national and international trade in wildlife meat and purportedly medicinal products. Indiscriminate wire snares have reduced populations severely of almost all ground-dwelling mammal species of rabbit-size or larger in the Annamites, and while Annamite Striped Rabbit may be slightly buffered from the effects of snaring operations by its small size and presumed small home range, there is both direct and indirect evidence that industrial-level snaring has reduced greatly its population. In Viet Nam, Timmins et al. (1999) mentioned a snared individual from just north of Phong Nha Ke Bang NP; a snared individual was found in Ha Tinh province (Dang et al. 2001); a skeleton was found in a snare by Timmins and Trinh (1999); remains were found in a snare in the same area of Ha Tinh (N. Furey pers. comm. 2002); and one was found in a brush-fence-style snare line in the Hue SNR (A. Tilker pers. comm. 2016). In Lao PDR, one was found dead in a wire snare close to eastern Xe Sap NPA (K. Thongasmouth pers. comm. 2013). At least four animals, all presumed to have been snared, were seen in the local market at Ban Lak-20 (= Ban Lak Xao) in the 1990s (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2018). The numbers observed in snares or otherwise in trade gives no suggestion, relative to the frequency with which other sympatric species have similarly been observed, that snaring pressure is any less significant a threat to rabbits than it is to any other species of similar or larger size. The scarcity of records since about 2010 in many localities within the species’s range offers the most compelling evidence of snaring-driven declines. For example, in Bach Ma NP, where both past and current snaring levels have reached staggering magnitudes, Annamite Striped Rabbit appears as of 2018, on the basis of extensive camera-trapping, to be rare (see 'Population'). Although without pre-exploitation baselines it is not possible to prove declines in any particular area, the ecological conditions in Bach Ma NP resemble those in the Hue and Quang Nam SNRs (adjacent to Bach Ma NP), where Annamite Striped Rabbit densities are higher. It is thus reasonable to assume that without intensive hunting pressure, Annamite Striped Rabbit would be much more common in Bach Ma NP than at present, and that its rarity there is a consequence of hunting. Similar patterns of decline are evident at other localities in Viet Nam, including the Ke Go – Khe Net Lowlands: industrial-level snaring is likely to have caused the decline in this species there, as well as in a number of other ground-dwelling species. Although snaring numbers recorded by Willcox et al. (2015) are relatively low (fewer than 1,500 snares), this result came from a relatively small area of forest and during only approximately three months’ survey, indicating a high overall snaring intensity (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2018). Most wildlife was recorded at the very tops of the hills in the protected area, away from the main snare lines (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2018). Although information does not span the relevant period, the highest intensity of snaring may have ceased well before the 2010 surveys, given that large numbers of abandoned snares were not found. Mortality from hunting dogs occurs in some areas. Local reports from hunters operating near the Quang Nam SNR in central Viet Nam suggest that while hunters do not target Annamite Striped Rabbit with dogs, it is captured opportunistically while hunters walk the streams at night, and that such events may not be uncommon (A. Tilker pers. comm. 2016). Hunters report that when the species is illuminated by lamp-light it freezes, allowing the hunter to shoot the rabbit or the dogs to attack and kill it. Two separate encounters with two separate individuals in the same area of Quang Nam SNR, in which both animals were captured by hand (and then released unharmed), provide evidence for this behaviour (S. Woodfin pers. comm. 2015; A. Tilker pers. comm. 2015). Villagers from Ban Kalo, in Xekong province, Lao PDR, reported a similar opportunistic hunting of Annamite Striped Rabbit using local hunting dogs (A. Tilker pers. comm. 2014). While there is no evidence for a specific market demand for Annamite Striped Rabbit, and while it does not command the high prices of some species targeted for the wildlife trade such as pangolins Manis or some turtles, it is plausible that its meat can sometimes fetch a higher-than-average price because of novelty.Habitat degradation, loss and fragmentation are major threats only insomuch as they increase accessibility to hunters. Viet Nam’s aggressive road building policy, particularly in border regions, has in recent years increased accessibility to previously little-disturbed habitat for farmers and timber harvesters (semi-commercial and commercial logging operations), as well as for mammal poachers. Dams, which so far have had minimal impact, look set to increase in the future; they not only reduce habitat but also increase accessibility to commercial hunters and harvesters of other forest products, who take wildlife meat opportunistically whilst pursuing other activities. Similarly, the expansion of the road network in many border areas of Lao PDR (e.g., Salavan and Xekong provinces) will improve access into areas of Annamite Striped Rabbit range and, in the absence of functioning law enforcement, increase levels of snaring of mammals potentially to intensities similar to much of the species' Viet Namese range. Mining for gold, gems and other minerals seems to be on the rise, which results in habitat destruction and increased hunting levels.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Decreasing control of Coyotes (Canis latrans),  Bobcats (Lynx rufus), and other predators has led to an increase in  predation on this species.The Magdalena Island Black-tailed Jackrabbit (L. c. magdalenae) shares its habitat with predators such as Coyotes (Canis latrans peninsulae) with an average population density estimated of 0.73 individuals/km² and a number estimated of 230 individuals on the island, which may be negatively affecting the endemic populations of this subspecies.

The high density of Feral Cats represents competing exotic fauna that can affect the endemic populations of the jackrabbits on the island (Lorenzo et al. 2014, 2018).The  Carmen Island Black-tailed Jackrabbit (L. c. sheldoni) also shares its  range with a high density of Feral Cats, which may be affecting the  population of the island's endemic subspecies (Lorenzo et al. 2014,  2018).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Dogs are a common problem in Chilean protected areas, including each of those where the Darwin’s Fox is present. Domestic dogs would represent a risk for foxes through intra-guild killing, as well as through disease transmission (Jiménez and McMahon 2004, Cabello et al. 2013a,b). The death of Darwin’s Foxes due to dog attacks has been reported both on the mainland (D’Elia et al. 2013) and in Chiloé (Espinosa 2011, J. Jiménez pers. obs.). Moreira-Arce et al. (2015a) found a negative correlation between the areas used by dogs and foxes in Nahuelbuta. Accordingly, in Chiloé Island, Darwin’s Foxes are rare or absent from old-growth forests frequently visited by dogs, while they are frequently recorded at camera traps in scrublands when dogs are absent (A. Farías pers. obs.), suggesting spatial displacement. It is important to note that the dog problem that affects Darwin’s Foxes, is caused in most, if not all, cases by poorly managed free-ranging dogs and not feral dogs (D. Moreira pers. obs., E.A. Silva-Rodríguez et al. pers. obs.).The risk of disease spillover from dogs (mainly Canine Distemper Virus, CDV) is considered a major threat for Darwin’s Fox populations (e.g., Jiménez and McMahon 2004, Silva-Rodríguez et al. 2015). Exposure of dogs to CDV has been shown in the proximity of Nahuelbuta National Park (Acosta-Jamett et al. 2015b) and Valdivian Coastal Reserve-Alerce Costero National Park (Sepúlveda et al. 2014). Furthermore, exposure to CDV has been reported for invasive American minks (Neovison vison) in areas were the Darwin’s Fox is present (Sepúlveda et al. 2014), as well as for Chilla (Lycalopex griseus) and Culpeo (Lycalopex culpaeus) in other regions (Acosta-Jamett et al. 2015a). Additionally, Jiménez et al. (2012) reported the death of three radio-collared foxes in Chiloé in sympatry with free-ranging dogs, suggesting that mortality could have been caused by CDV, although conclusive evidence was not available. CDV epizootics in canids have been reported worldwide (e.g., Goller et al. 2010, Di Sabatino et al. 2014), and CDV was implicated in a major decline in the population of the Island Fox (Urocyon littoralis) in Santa Catalina Island (Timm et al. 2009). In South America, Megid et al. (2009, 2010) reported CDV-related mortalities in wild canids in Brazil, and in Chile, Moreira and Stutzin (2005) reported the death of 27 Chilla and Culpeo foxes due to CDV in Coquimbo Region. The lack of conclusive evidence of declines due to CDV in the Darwin’s Fox may be well explained by lack of information, rather than by the absence of outbreaks.Darwin’s Foxes can also be subject to human-caused mortality. According to J. Jiménez (pers. obs.) and Espinosa (2011), local people in Chiloé reported killing foxes because they attack domestic animals and to obtain their fur. Foxes rescued from traps as well as captured and translocated after predation on poultry have also been reported in Chiloé (J. Cabello pers. obs.). Stowhas (2012) also indicated that local people reported killing foxes (undetermined species) in an area that included the surroundings of Oncol Park, Alerce Costero National Park, and Valdivian Coastal Reserve, as a response to predation on poultry. In Nahuelbuta range, foxes (without distinguishing to the level of species) are often considered as problem animals (Sánchez et al. 2014). However, Darwin’s Fox is not commonly persecuted or killed by local people (but see McMahon et al. 1999) and its conservation would show a high social support (D. Moreira pers. obs.).Forest loss is an important threat. The highest rates of forest loss occur in the coastal range of the Araucanía Region, where Nahuelbuta is located. There, the annual loss rate observed for the 1999-2008 period reached 4.8%, the second highest reported for Chilean temperate forest (Miranda et al. 2015). For the Valdivian Coastal Range, the net forest loss between 1985 and 2011 was 5.1% (and the gross loss reached 30%), but the loss rate was higher for the 1985-1999 period than for the 1999-2011 period (Zamorano-Elgueta et al. 2015). In northern Chiloé and Maullín, the annual rates of forest loss was close to 1% (1985-2007), although in the case of Chiloé this rate rose to 1.4% for the 1999-2007 period (Echeverría et al. 2012). Both in the Araucanía and Valdivian cases, cleared native forest was frequently converted to forestry plantations (Miranda et al. 2015, Zamorano-Elgueta et al. 2015). Although Darwin’s Fox has been recorded in plantations (Farías et al. 2014, J. Jiménez pers. obs.), evidence from the population in Nahuelbuta shows that foxes select for native forest (Moreira-Arce et al. 2015a). However, if managed through an increase of native understory cover, commercial plantations may provide complementary habitats and food resources for this species (Moreira-Arce et al. 2015b). Human-induced fires are an always-latent threat, especially for the Nahuelbuta range (D. Moreira pers. obs.). On the other hand, deforestation may favour other (larger sized) fox species (i.e. Lycalopex griseus and L. culpaeus), better adapted to open areas (e.g., Silva-Rodríguez et al. 2010), which can displace Darwin’s Foxes (Jiménez et al. 1991). The indirect effects of changes in land cover through alteration of interaction webs are still insufficiently known.Indirect threats that need to be considered include the construction of bridges, highways and roads. Of major concern is the projected construction of the bridge connecting Chiloé to the mainland. This bridge, if barriers are not implemented, may facilitate the invasion of the island by other species such as congeneric foxes and Pumas (Puma concolor), with unknown, but potentially serious consequences for these populations. Road construction and improvement is an additional concern, given that they facilitate dog (Moreira-Arce et al. 2015a, Sepúlveda et al. 2015) and human movement, and can lead to land cover change (Wilson et al. 2005). Existing roads, as well as the construction of new roads and/or the improvement of existing public roads, is a concern for Nahuelbuta (Sánchez et al. 2014), the Valdivian Coastal Range (Silva-Rodríguez et al. 2015) and for Chiloé (J. Cabello pers. obs.).Other threats that need to be taken into account include the translocation of rescued and problem animals (J. Cabello pers. obs.) and illegal tenure of foxes as pets (J. Jiménez pers. obs.).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In the San Joaquin Valley of California, habitat conversion for agriculture is slowing, but habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation associated with industrial and urban development are still occurring at a rapid pace. More recently, expansive industrial-scale solar energy generating facilities are being constructed throughout the western USA, but particularly in California, Arizona, and Nevada.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

However, human activity is rising rapidly in many parts of the Sahara. Construction of new roads, bettering of non-asphalted roads and new human settlements increase the disturbance and risk to some populations. Ongoing seismic surveys, exploratory drilling and oil field developments, coupled with increasing development of commercial transport and migration routes across recently remote parts of the region, create further pressure. The impact of major oil field development on local populations has not been assessed. Direct impacts include increased risk of ‘roadkills’ and risk to naïve desert living Fennecs, which can show lack of fear and curiosity when approached by vehicles. Locally, in North Africa, the main threat appears to be trapping for exhibition or sale to tourists. Though restricted to marginal areas, new permanent human settlements such as those in southern Morocco have resulted in the disappearance of foxes in these areas (F.

Limited drinking water and food appear to keep populations at low density in central Kenya (mean annual rainfall <500 mm), and probably elsewhere. Greatly increased human and livestock populations have led to declines and extirpations in recent decades in central Kenya; competition for water and food has become intense as the region is severely over-stocked with livestock, both outside and inside officially protected areas (De Jong and Butynski 2014, A.

Many protected areas were established during the Dutch colonial period but from independence up until the 1970s they were largely under-funded and neglected. After hosting the World Parks Conference in 1982, the Indonesian government gazetted a swathe of national parks and more structured conservation planning began, funded by the World Bank and other donors. The focus was largely on the 'multi-function' national parks and much money was spent on infrastructure, some staff training and increased personnel. The 'lesser' protected areas such as ""game reserves"" and ""nature reserves"" still had few staff and resources, and that has continued to the present. During the 1980s to the mid 1990s, guns were tightly controlled and the military and police were feared and respected. However, the strong culture of caged bird keeping meant that hunting, including that within protected areas, was primarily for birds and some small game, through various forms of trapping, including snaring; this latter could well have included chevrotains. There was some habitat loss from protected areas through illegal logging, agricultural encroachment and other offtake, but the national parks of Java remained remarkably intact for much of this period. Socio-political changes from 1997 led to a reduction in the respect for the police and military and the rise of a viewpoint that protected areas were the peoples' resources and would therefore benefit from decentralised management (S. Hedges and M. Tyson pers. comms. 2008). This policy change, which risked a ‘tragedy of the commons’, has indeed led to increased destruction and poaching in the past decade. There is some evidence that species readily uses edge and secondary vegetation, meaning that effects of forest encroachment will be less serious than for old-growth forest obligates. Moreover, chevrotains already seemed rare for surveyors operating in the early–mid 1990s, when habitats had been relatively stable since 1970s or early 1980s. For any decline which may have occurred in the 1980s and early–mid 1990s, therefore, habitat factors are an unlikely driver.Chevrotains occur regularly in markets in towns such as Jakarta, Surabaya, Yogyakarta, and Malang, but often they are cramped in small cages, and can therefore be overlooked, and may even be more common than observations suggest; numbers in trade are surprisingly high given the small numbers to be seen in the field nowadays (V. Nijman pers. comm. 2008). They have been traded at high levels for many decades: Hoogerwerf (1970) wrote of “numerous reports of mouse deer being regularly trapped and offered for sale alive” in Java. They are hunted and traded both for pets and as wild meat (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). Numbers passing through markets in Jakarta, Bogor, and Sukabumi have recently declined sharply, perhaps because of tightened control by the forest police in those markets; but there is the possibility that falling trade might indicate, at least in part, increasing difficulty to catch the animal and thus a decline in populations. In the Malang area, it is still “relatively easy” to procure one, although it is “getting time consuming” (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008). Hunting is probably largely with snares; dogs are also likely to be a serious threat (M. Tyson pers. comm. 2008). They are vulnerable to active hunting at night through a propensity to freeze when spotlit. However, the effects of these comparably high hunting levels on the genus in Java have not been studied empirically.The continued presence of many animals in markets suggests that significant populations remain somewhere on Java (assuming that the animals are not now imports from elsewhere in Indonesia), and thus that a major decline may not have occurred, despite current indications. A comparable situation was found with Inornate Squirrel Callosciurus inornatus in Lao PDR, when extensive 1990s surveys found few animals in the field, in contrast with historic statements of abundance and ongoing substantial numbers being traded in fresh meat markets. This led to conservation concern for the species (e.g. Duckworth et al. 1999); but later field survey of degraded and edge areas found out that the species was indeed common and evidently a species associated with degraded areas, and had hence been severely under-recorded by the 1990s surveys (Timmins and Duckworth 2008).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

Invasive non-native plants (and consequent weed-control programs) may also threaten the habitat (USFWS 1998). It is important to keep in mind that little is known about the population dynamics of this subspecies. Thus, evaluations of viability should be made very carefully.For subspecies campestris overgrazing of riparian areas by domestic stock has resulted in the loss of much of the suitable habitat. Such overgrazing is still considered to be the main threat to this subspecies.Because of subspecies luteus reliance on limited mesic grassland and riparian areas, habitat destruction is of major concern. Agricultural development, including livestock grazing, has destroyed or severally altered riparian habitat in New Mexico and Arizona.

The 2008 assessment of threats is reiterated below along with updates and qualifications based on new information since that time.As of 2008, suitable habitat for the Large-antlered Muntjac is still extensive (under the reasonable assumption that it uses secondary forest), but, especially within Viet Nam, it seems absent from many accessible, but superficially, at least, suitable habitat blocks. In the intervening period there has been an acceleration in the rate of habitat loss at low to mid elevations, especially in the Southern Annamites, as clearly indicated by comparison of satellite images from different periods over the last few decades. This strongly indicates that over-hunting is its primary threat. Heavy deployment of camera-traps in several interior forests of Viet Nam produced few photographs, showing that Large-antlered Muntjac can be rare even in the most remote areas. A decline would suggest great susceptibility to hunting, but it is possible that it was never common in the types of interior closed-canopy forest surveyed and is restricted to specific types (not yet camera-trapped) or may even be strongly associated with edges. If the latter, then a high proportion of the population would be facing very heavy hunting pressure as well as an accelerating threat of habitat loss due to clear-felling for plantation forestry, because of proximity to settlement of much of the suitable habitat. Whatever the explanation for the rarity of records in most camera-trapping areas, it suggests a much stronger level of threat than has hitherto been appreciated (e.g. by Timmins et al. 1998, Duckworth et al. 1999, the listing as only Provisionally At Risk in Lao PDR in the latter is now clearly inappropriately optimistic). While the socio-economic factors outlined in this section bear on the conservation status of all ungulates and primates, of most carnivores, and of many other mammals in Lao PDR and Viet Nam, Large-antlered Muntjac is probably one of two species (the other being Saola Pseudoryx nghetinhensis) which is most at global risk through them. This is because it is big enough to be a main wildlife meat source, it does not have populations secured in other countries such as India, Nepal and Thailand, with installed effective management in at least some protected areas, it does not have populations in the rugged mountain forest blocks where trade-driven hunting of species valued only for their meat (rather than high-value, low-weight, generally medicinal products that can be carried out efficiently from even the remotest areas) is limited by economics of accessibility, and it does not occur on the plains where (for a mix of essentially non-biological reasons) protected area management is being most successful in conserving ungulates (e.g. Cambodia).Large-antlered Muntjacs are hunted within a thriving hunting and wildlife trading culture which abounds in all range states and in adjacent countries such as China and Thailand, involving many land vertebrate species, along with other forest products such as orchids and Aquilaria resin (e.g. Compton and Le Hai Quang 1998, Compton et al. 1999, Noreen and Claridge 2001). Hunters do not target Large-antlered Muntjacs, but are seeking any and all species with marketable meat and products for the medicinal markets. Such hunting reaches all this muntjac’s range, and with so many species and products, non-selective methods continue at high levels until the most resilient species is no longer common enough for hunting to be commercially viable. This non-specificity makes regional hunting practices a peculiarly strong driver of localised and, in aggregate, regional, extinctions (e.g. Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002). The regional wild meat trade has little likelihood of abating as long as there are any pigs, muntjacs, and civets to be hunted or there becomes a serious commitment on the behalf of range-state governments to address the issue. Large-antlered Muntjacs will be extinct long before these more resilient species become so rare that communities are driven to ‘fishing down’ for smaller species using methods that do not threaten Large-antlered Muntjacs. In 2015, the human population of Viet Nam exceeds 93 million, that of China 1 billion. Together, they comprise an enormous market for wildlife products. For example, tens of millions of wild turtles are imported, legally and illegally, into China annually (van Dijk et al. 2000 and papers therein). There has been no comparable study of ungulate trade levels.Hunting in Large-antlered Muntjacs's range is therefore very high: in the Northern and Central Annamites of Viet Nam, in a range shared with Saola, an estimated eight million people, almost all with the propensity to eat wildlife and mostly with direct links to the urban wildlife trade, live within 100 km of forest inhabited by Saola, and probably nowhere in the range of Large-antlered Muntjac is further than 30 km from a village (Timmins et al. 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Within the Northern and Central Annamites, every square kilometre of Vietnamese forest and of Lao forest that is within 5 km of the Vietnamese border probably has snares capable of capturing Large-antlered Muntjac set in it every year (Timmins et al. 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Very localised law enforcement efforts especially in the Hue and Quang Nam Saola Nature Reserves since 2011/2012, has probably to some extent mitigated this, and some small pockets of high-elevation terrain and the remotest of areas (e.g. limestone terrain) probably escape such high pressure, but countering this, snaring intensity in Lao areas in particular has certainly increased. Intensity in some areas probably reaches many thousands of snare-nights per km² per year (Timmins et al. 2007). Snaring is less intensive in Lao PDR at least away from the Vietnamese border, but the intensity and spatial scale of snaring is increasing dramatically (Timmins 2013a, Duckworth et al. 2010, Timmins in press a, b, Coudrat et al. 2014 a, b). Hunting intensity has in recent decades been generally lower in southern Viet Nam than in Lao PDR and the northern and central Annamites of Viet Nam, leaving many wildlife populations less depleted (e.g. Le Xuan Canh et al. 1997, Timmins and Duckworth 2000, Polet and Ling 2004), but the general increase in regional hunting intensity and economic wealth indicate that hunting intensity in this region must also be increasing. In 2014 this appears now to be almost certainly the case over large areas of the Southern Annamites, even though sites such as Cat Tien NP retain anomalously healthy large mammal populations in a Vietnamese context, in many areas in fact hunting intensity of ground dwelling mammals may be approaching the levels of the Northern and Central Annamites (Timmins in press a, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), furthermore habitat loss in the Southern Annamites appears to be accelerating with substantial loss of mid-elevation forest already having occurred for instance on the Dak Nong – Mondulkiri Plateau (Timmins in press a, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2015 based on a review of satellite images).Closed tropical evergreen forests have inherently low ungulate biomass (Robinson and Bennett 2000), and beyond this populations of all wild animals larger than 20 kg in most of Large-antlered Muntjac’s range have been significantly reduced by human exploitation (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins et al. 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), the paucity of records across its range shows that this includes Large-antlered Muntjac itself. Field survey encounter rates even with Northern Red Muntjacs and pigs in much of Large-antlered Muntjac's range are remarkably low compared with other areas in Asia (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins et al. 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), wild cattle, Asian Elephant, and Tiger are all nearing extinction in this muntjac’s range (e.g. Duckworth and Hedges 1998), and in some of the worst-hit protected areas even the generally robust Northern Red Muntjac and wild pig are ecologically extinct (e.g. the western lowlands of Xe Bang-Nouan NPA, Lao PDR, J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008, based on 2007 field visit). Further surveys since 2008 have only reinforced this picture of dwindling wildlife populations and probable local extirpation of the most vulnerable species in ever more fragmented landscapes (Timmins in press a, b, Timmins 2013a, Suford 2010, Duckworth et al. 2010, Timmins 2009. In the Nakai Plateau and Nakai-Nam Theun NPA, in some sectors the Large-antlered Muntjac and Northern Red Muntjac are similar in abundance. Comparison with other areas, where the former is much scarcer than the latter, implies that the Large-antlered is much more sensitive to hunting than is the Northern Red Similar results from Laving Laveun PPA further reinforce the probability that hunting above all else is the primary factor behind scarcity of the species in most Annamite forests at mid elevations (R.J Timmins pers. comm 2015). It may be intentionally targeted more (although there is no evidence for this, and it seems unlikely), or some facet of population biology such as fecundity (possible given its slightly larger size) may make it less resilient, or it may be associated with habitats that (for other reasons) are targeted by hunters. This latter factor is certainly true at the landscape scale: Large-antlered Muntjac primarily uses lower altitudes, yet forest blocks remote enough for hunting levels to be restrained by the economics of access and removal of meat are primarily mountainous areas of high altitude forest. If Large-antlered Muntjac is an edge species, densities in large un-encroached closed forest blocks would be low anyway. The lower-altitude disturbed forests may be the most suitable habitat for this muntjac, but because they are closer to high human population densities than are montane or little-encroached blocks, they support higher levels of generalised snaring and hunting. In comparison, Northern Red Muntjac has large populations in such high-altitude remote forest blocks, which may act as a repopulation reservoir for lower altitude areas. It is difficult to think of any habitat that could be a source for Large-antlered Muntjac. Since 2008 there have been no new observations to suggest that the above speculation is not broadly accurate, whilst new camera-trapping data solidifies the assumption that the species is primarily associated with forests below c. 1,000 m.While demand for wild meat is the major driver of muntjac trade, parts such as antlers may be used for medicinal purposes. There is also the curio/status symbol appeal of trophy antlers: some are even on display in Bangkok (A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2000). Since 2008 there appears to have been an upsurge in the trade in trophy antlers (of all species), to the extent that it is now often difficult to find Large-antlered Muntjac trophies within villages, the trade appears to favour trophies with large antlers (Timmins 2013a, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), one can only speculate that this will inevitably increase pressure on the species.The effects of hunting in Lao PDR and Viet Nam have been exacerbated during the last two decades by habitat loss and various socio-economic factors, of which the most biologically significant seem to be:Economic development and expanding wealth in the region are increasing the demand for wildlife meat and ‘medicines’ (Timmins et al. 2007). Sage and Nguyen Cu (2001) and Timmins et al. (2007) highlighted a common misconception, especially in documentation of development projects in the region, that poverty is a principal cause of biodiversity loss, but as they pointed out for Saola, the main driver of threats for Saola, Large-antlered Muntjac and many other species, at least for the mid-term, is not rural poverty but increasing urban wealth in Indochina and China. In Viet Nam “the free market economy has resulted in feverish periods of trade in wild species nationwide, with negative impacts on biodiversity” (Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2004). In Cambodia, the same factor has fostered a thriving bushmeat market and hunting of species for international wildlife trade (Timmins and Ou 2001, Maxwell et al. 2006, Timmins 2006). There is a rapid, ongoing, expansion of wealthy social strata in Lao PDR, directly accelerated by illegal trade in rosewood, wild meat, and other forest resources, and by the economics of large infrastructure projects (e.g. Nan Theun 2 hydro-electric power project), creating a significantly greater in-country demand for luxury meats such as venison (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2007). Markets along major roads such as route 13 (e.g. at Ban Namthon) have expanded, not contracted, in the last 15 years and have a huge (albeit unquantified) turnover of wild meat, at this specific market, multiple stalls are selling dried muntjac meat daily (balance of muntjac species unknown). If anything, trade has grown since 2008, and become more sophisticated, this appears particularly so in Lao PDR, as its border with Viet Nam has become increasingly opened up by new roads and upgrading of old border crossings (R.J. Timmins pers. comm 2015).Road development in Viet Nam, especially the recent construction through the Annamite Mountains in Viet Nam of the Ho Chi Minh Highway, parallel to the Lao border, with its many feeder roads to Lao PDR and Cambodia that boost connectivity of rural areas to regional wildlife trade markets, is a severe and probably unmitigatable threat (Timmins et al. 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). From the late 1990s there has also been a dramatic upgrading and expansion of national and regional road networks in Lao PDR, primarily it seems to make all inhabited areas of the country readily accessible (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2008). New road linkages in Mondulkiri Province, Cambodia, are making the area’s natural resources more easily marketable (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Since 2008 road development and upgrading has continued and probably even increased in intensity especially in what were once remote border areas (Timmins 2013a, Timmins in press a,b).Shifting cultivation of local communities is resulting in a net loss of forest and even of dense secondary habitats, and is fragmenting larger forest blocks because of the dispersion of settlements. Shifting cultivation per se could even be beneficial for this muntjac, but recent trends are decreasing the suitability of what might be called ‘the shifting cultivation estate’. These trends centre round a decline in cycle length in rotational systems (hindering regrowth during the fallow period), partly through the increasing number of people depending upon an annually decreasing area, as forest land is lost to infrastructure, tree plantation crops and other forms of continuous agriculture, and partly through well-intentioned government policy to eradicate shifting cultivation. Habitat loss due to shifting cultivation has probably increased in intensity in many habitats of most relevance to the species since 2008, e.g. peripheral degraded forest at mid elevation (Timmins 2013a, Timmins in press a,b) especially in the southern Annamites of Viet Nam where rubber, pine and acacia plantations are targeted on secondary forest patches.Recent moves towards landscape-scale habitat clearance for agro-industrial developments particularly in plateau areas of Cambodia and southern Viet Nam, and even in foothill areas of northern parts of the Lao and Vietnamese range of the species, would presumably remove available habitat, further fragment remaining forest areas, increase local affluence and result in new roads. However, this muntjac’s potential use of plantations is not assessed, and probably cannot be, because all such developments are increasing the area in which hunting is easy and at high levels (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Since 2008 as with most other threats, habitat loss from concessions appears to be on the increase, with for instance large areas of plateau forest already lost in the Southern Annamites (Timmins in press a).Hydropower development throughout the Annamites, particularly in the Nam Theun/Nam Kading basin in Lao PDR, floods habitat but more importantly fuels hunting levels through increasing access, affluence and market connectivity. The Nakai Plateau, part of the only area known still to support good numbers of Large-antlered Muntjac, was flooded for a hydropower headpond during mid 2008. This destroyed part of the species' range on the plateau, but the project will continue to stimulate hunting. Currently, there are barely-navigable stretches of rocky channel (called kengs) on all streams flowing out from the NPA. All these kengs will be easily passable when the reservoir is full. As predicted the Nam Theun 2 reservoir has had a huge negative effect on remaining plateau areas and the NPA (W.G. Robichaud and J. W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2015). Nam Kading NPA, further down the same catchment, is also threatened by a hydropower project which will result in a highly dendritic headpond allowing ready access to most of this NPA and so undoubtedly will increase hunting levels significantly. Other reservoirs have in the interim been completed in both Lao PDR (e.g. on the Nam Gnouang) and Viet Nam (e.g., a reservoir abutting the Hue SNR) surely leading to similar consequences (Timmins in press b, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).Growing economic stability and developing infrastructure in all three range countries have initiated a flood of proposals for industrial-scale mineral extraction, particularly in the mineral-rich Annamites (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The effects of this on proportionate loss of habitat remain to be seen, they will probably be overshadowed the presence of large numbers of non-local workers with good market connectivity and thus a propensity to hunt, or to pay local people to hunt. In 2015 expansion of mineral concessions has perhaps not been as dramatic as feared, although there are still plans and rumours concerning concessions in many areas, and small-scale gold mining operations are present in many relatively remote forest areas (Timmins 2013a, Timmins in press b).Recent changes in immigration agreements between Lao PDR and Viet Nam and between Lao PDR and China make it much easier for Vietnamese and Chinese people to visit, settle in and conduct business in Lao PDR, and with a clear build-up of Vietnamese nationals in pivotal wildlife trade centres such as Ban Lak-20 (= ‘Ban Lak Xao’) on the edge of Nakai–Nam Theun NPA, trade networks with Viet Nam are now better than ever and still improving (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2007).Additional factors hindering the species' survival include:The difficulties of distinction between this species and Northern Red Muntjac impede its potential legal protection, particularly in situations where a differential status between the Large-antlered and Northern Red applies.Customary rights of local people to hunt ‘sustainably’ within most Lao and some Vietnamese protected areas urgently need modification if most of the ungulate species are to survive in such areas (see the Conservation Measures section).As pointed out by Timmins et al. (2007), protected area management skills and commitment to the system are still evolving in the Annamites, and this progress lags behind expansion of market-led hunting. Currently, existing protected areas are not stanching declines in ungulates. Protected areas have so far proven impotent in the control of poaching or as a mechanism to safeguard areas from economic development such as hydropower projects, road construction, and mining (Timmins et al. 2007). It will require a major consolidation of effort to install effective anti-hunting measures in any protected area within the range of Large-antlered Muntjac within the next five years (Timmins et al. 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008) and protected area strengthening projects should be thinking in terms of a few decades of collaboration, not a few years (e.g., Leisher 2001). Yet, there is even the danger of the few currently promising protected areas regressing through loss of external funding and talented professionals, ongoing political indifference towards them, and thereby forcing an unfettered short-termism in local residents’ behaviour through a lack of alternative options. There is no plausible method to conserve this species (and others of high value to the wildlife trade which show little resilience to hunting) alternative to protected areas, the problem is arising not through a flawed concept, but through naive optimism about the time-scales and resource inputs needed to effect situational change, coupled with insufficient political will to enact effective protected area management by all range state governments.The potential of Nakai–Nam Theun NPA to conserve the species has fallen far short of expectations. The area receives substantial, guaranteed annual funding from the Nam Theun 2 hydropower project (approximately USD 1 million annually), in compensation for reservoir inundation of wildlife habitat on the Nakai Plateau. As of 2015, after nearly a decade of over USD 1 million being spent per year by the NPA’s management, there is little progress in restraining offtake of ungulates and other wildlife. This reflects low starting capacity resulting from inappropriate staff selection policies, a poorly structured capacity-building programme, no link between performance and provision of annual budget, internal financial irregularities and, most trenchantly, uneven commitment to the protected area’s aims internally, and from the mass of other government bodies with influence over WMPA.. National-level government policy favours tangible aspects of rural development (road building, plantation agriculture, etc.) over what is perceived as ‘wildlife conservation’. Corruption that both protects and promotes the unsustainable offtake of natural resources (e.g., forest timber, wildlife for trade) is also a major issue. The situation reached a crisis point in 2014 when two external reviews corroborated the Nam Theun 2 project’s own International Environmental and Social Panel of Experts’ long-standing and intensifying concerns over continued gross underperformance, and the panel recommended dissolution of the WMPA management structure (McDowell et al. 2014). As of late 2015, most WMPA senior staff have in fact been removed, but their replacements have not yet been appointed.In Bolikhamxay Province to the north, some progress has been made in wildlife conservation, particularly through a decade-long cooperative program between the province and the Wildlife Conservation Society. However, ongoing restriction by the province and central government for program personnel to enter some of the most important areas in the Annamites along the border of Viet Nam, due to unspecified ‘security concerns’, considerably hamper attempts to conserve rare ungulates there if still present, such as Saola and Large-antlered Muntjac.The only site within the species’ range where levels of law enforcement patrolling and protected management are close to levels required to reduce threats to Large-antlered Muntjac are the Hue and Quang Nam Saola Nature Reserves in central Viet Nam, and possibly some focal areas of Nakai-Nam Theun. However even at these sites it is likely that few, if any, areas are either sufficiently remote, or patrolled with sufficient regularity or intensity, to remove threats to the species. In addition there are no confirmed recent records of Large-antlered Muntjac from the two reserves in Viet Nam, which clearly suffered extensive hunting prior to gazettement, and the species may have become extinct from these sites. Adjacent areas of eastern Xe Sap National Protected Area, Lao PDR, receive little protection and despite efforts to establish enforcement teams with similar mandates as within Hue and Quang Nam, current patrol intensity and levels of snare removal are not close to that required. It should be noted that snare removal in these sites is conducted primarily by trained, local community members, with ranger assistance and support from WWF, not primarily by government staff.There is a lack of appreciation in the decision-making levels relevant to protected areas, including those with externally collaborative management support projects, of the biodiversity value of lower altitude yet degraded forests relative to high altitude forests which have been less encroached. This results in mis-prioritisation of core protected zones within protected areas. The common situation is that all lower-altitude forests are degraded, and it is this very degradation that makes them of high priority: their conservation status is already so poor that there are no pristine areas left in most of the range of the Large-antlered Muntjac. This is a problem for a wide suite of species restricted to the lower altitudes, not just to this muntjac, but because of its globally small range, it may be the mammal at most global risk through this factor (with the possible exception of Saola).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In the Ituri Forest road creation associated with selective logging results in spontaneous human colonization, leading to the clearing of mature forest for agricultural purposes (Makana and Thomas 2006). Fragmentation of the Irangi forest is due to the increasing human population, with new areas of land being cleared for building and farming. Many large trees are felled to make way for agriculture and provide timber for building and smaller trees are regularly cut for firewood and bushes cleared to make way for farming (Kizunga 2011).The part of Irangi which is of conservation importance, ranges in elevation from 750m (near the main road Bukavu-Walikale-Kisangani) to 1,600m (Mount Elimu) and holds the largest tracts of transitional forest (Kizunga 2011).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

Hunting occurs in all areas it is found apart from the most protected and remote forests (Mt. Kilimanjaro in the Udzungwa Mountains National Park). Although individuals can persist in closed-canopy forests of less than 1 km², logging, including selective logging of large trees, removes shelter trees, destroys arboreal pathways, and makes animals more vulnerable and prone to ground trapping (Roberts et al. 2013). Eastern Tree Hyraxes are hunted for their meat and skins. Skins are used to make blankets or karosses, which can still be found for sale in Arusha and Moshi, dating back to the 1970s when commercial exploitation was quite severe (Kundaeli 1976b). Hyraxes are trapped using snares set at the head of runnels (pathways through the undergrowth) near the base of a tree or in rocky outcrops. They may also be clubbed, speared, or run down by dogs having been ’smoked out’ or following the felling of a den tree (a common method employed in the Udzungwa Mts; Topp- Jørgensen et al. 2008).  Hunting for hyrax with dogs also occurs in a number of other Eastern Arc Mountains, such as the East Usambaras (N. Cordeiro pers. comm.), Pemba and Zanzibar Islands, Kilindi, Rubeho, Uluguru, Mahenge and Nguru Mountains (A. Perkin pers. obs). ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

These fires are causing a slow reduction in forest area, particularly in the Ndundulu – Luhomero forest.  In addition, with the distribution of sengis in Mwanihana forest extending lower than it was believed earlier (Rovero et al. 2013), the threat of forest destruction from fires set by people now extends to the lower edges of this forest.An analysis of changes in forest and woodland areas for the period 1970-2000 was carried out for the Udzungwa Mountains by the Forestry and Beekeeping Division of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism (2006; see also Burgess et al. 2007). The study was based on analysis of remotely sensed images of land cover and ground-truthing. For the present assessment, the analysis was applied to the extent of occurrence of R. udzungwensis (courtesy of Jenny Hewson, Center for Applied Biodiversity Science, Conservation International). The results reveal that Ndundulu-Luhomero forest has faced a reduction of 2.71% between 1970 and 2000, Mwanihana forest has faced a reduction of 0.52%, and the woodland area between these two forests was degraded by 56%. Habitat loss in this area is mainly attributed to human-induced or natural fires. Fires appear to have caused major degradation of the woodland (including the low elevation, deciduous forest in Mwanihana) along with evergreen forest loss that mainly occurred at the edges and interior clearings. As R. udzungwensis appears to be restricted to forest interiors (Rovero et al. 2013), the gradual reduction in total forest area will reduce the habitat available to the species.Whilst there is no evidence of hunting by the local people, the ethnic tribe living in the western Udzungwa plateaux (called the Wahehe) are known to routinely practice subsistence hunting, including of the Giant Sengi Rhynchocyon cirnei (Nielsen 2006). This species occurs widely in the Udzungwa Mountains including areas near the Wahehe villages located to the west of the Ndundulu-Luhomero forest (T. Jones pers. comm.). Therefore, in addition to the predicted habitat reduction, with the growth and expansion of human population around protected areas in the Eastern Arc Mountains (Schipper and Burgess 2004), threats to the very localized R. udzungwensis are likely to increase.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Duckworth pers. comm. 2006), but the species' resilience to such hunting is unknown. The presumed Indian range is within areas of rapid habitat loss and human expansion, much of the Myanmar range is within an area which has seen remarkable stability of forest cover (Renner et al. 2007). However, this healthy situation may change in the near future, as some other forests of northern Kachin (which have not been surveyed for the species, and so may hold, or have held, it) have recently been devastated (Eames 2007). Although habitat needs, and thus the effects of forest fragmentation and degradation are essentially unknown, it is unlikely that viable populations can survive outright forest conversion. It is also likely that in areas where forest is being fragmented, negative effects of hunting on populations of Leaf Muntjac are compounded and populations decline, whatever intrinsic ability the species has to use fragmented areas.Rabinowitz et al. (1999) suggested that this species and other muntjacs are less adaptable than other deer, and that this might explain the ‘restricted’ ranges of this and other small muntjacs. However, the most widespread muntjacs, M. muntjak, M. vaginalis, and M. reevesi, are very successful: they use a wide variety of forested habitats, and are well able to exploit secondary and degraded habitats. Secondly, and contrary to the statements of Rabinowitz et al. (1999) and others, which have not taken into account the patchiness of suitable surveying, the ‘small’ muntjacs comprising the M. rooseveltorum species-complex are not particularly restricted in range, but are rather widespread in montane areas of northern southeast Asia. The lack of evidence of the complex from many areas, giving an apparent disjunct distribution, is much more likely to reflect the paucity of suitable surveys than the genuine distribution pattern. Survey work in southwest and southeast China, much of Myanmar, the Himalayan region and northern and western Thailand have certainly been insufficient to conclude anything about the range of this species-complex in those regions.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

Ewel pers. comm.). Mangrove forests occupy about 15% of the total land area of the island (K. Ewel pers. comm.).

Hunting of them by indigenous and settled local communities is widespread along the Western and Eastern Ghats. Madhusudan and Karanth (2000, 2002) give an account of the techniques used for hunting Chevrotains by people such as the Kuruba in tropical forests of Karnataka near and within Nagarahole and Kudremukha. Active hunting uses hunting dogs to locate and flush the animals and a club/machete to kill them, while passive means include dead-fall traps. Much of the hunting is for the pot, although wild meat is often sold in local markets in many places. This is one species that even women and children join with men in hunting during the day. The team of hunters beat bushes and flush animals toward nets held by people where the animals are caught and killed. In addition, low wire snares with many nooses may be placed along the ground across trails to catch passing Chevrotains. In the Dakshin Kannada district, 78% of 49 hunters interviewed by Madhusudan and Karanth (2002) ranked the Chevrotain as the species they hunted the most. They also believed that this had led to depressed abundance of the species in areas with hunting. Three-quarters of the hunters themselves identified hunting as the most important factor for the decline in abundance. The control of hunting therefore may be required for the conservation of the species. Raman (2004) provided no empirical information on habitat relevant to conservation. As a forest-associated species, forest conversion has obviously greatly reduced the area holding Indian Chevrotain over the past few millennia. Compared with most of the tropical world, outright forest conversion in its range has been low within recent decades: more serious has been degradation and fragmentation of what remains, but the Indian Chevrotain’s adaptability to fragmentation and degradation has never been studied. In Nepal, the Siwalik hills and Bhabar area that lie just north of the Gangetic plain presumably formed the northernmost range limit. These areas remained little disturbed until recently mainly because of malaria infestation and low quality land for cultivation. With the quashing of malaria, habitat conversion was rapid and now such habitat persist only within protected areas (H.S. Baral pers. comm. 2008).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0

Animals are hunted and trapped for their bones and heads, but most often monkeys are unintentionally trapped in iron traps that are set to trap deer or wild pigs to supply the local bush meat trade (this has been confirmed by local hunters and there is camera trap evidence of the monkeys travelling on the ground where traps have been set) (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012). Already with the still limited construction work camps, commercial bush meat demand  has increased sharply over the last two years (2010-2011) and is set to accelerate (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012). Monkeys may also be caught in traps set for bears (T. Geissmann pers. comm. 2012).Habitat degradation, due to the creation of roads and other infrastructure is rapidly becoming a major threat. Logging roads have now been built into all the areas occupied by this species since 2009 (some are within 200 m of the camera traps) (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012). With the increased access, the influx of Chinese workers to the area as part of the logging and dam building operations is accelerating and it is expected that when the dams reach the full construction stage there will be at least 10,000 workers employed in this area (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012).Habitat loss due the impacts of logging is very serious due to large scale mechanical logging (blasting of logging roads, use of heavy equipment and winches, reaching ridges and even peaks) taking place, especially as the largest part of the range area is conifer forest and during the snow-covered winter months the Snub-nosed Monkeys (just as R. bieti) depend on lichens for food (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012). As the logging is effecting most mature conifer trees, food sources especially in winter are becoming scarce. The logging practices are causing serious destruction because logging takes place at high altitudes and even on slopes with more than 70 degrees slope inclination (these areas are accessed using winches and roads are blasted through cliffs). Land slides are becoming increasingly common as a result of the loss of tree cover. The  lower mountain broad leaf forest is also impacted by logging (targeting hardwoods) and landslides caused by logging roads. Shifting cultivation reaches from the N'mai Hka river valley up to 2,000 meters, flooding following dam construction will displace shifting cultivation areas in the valley bottom to higher areas, increasing the pressures on the Snub-nosed Monkey habitat (F. Momberg pers. comm. 2012).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Other body parts, including male genital organs, foetuses and female tails, are also valued for traditional medicines and have similar market values (Zahler et al. 2004). The resulting illegal and unsustainable hunting has caused a 92% population decline over the past 18 years (Zahler et al. 2004). Habitat loss and fragmentation, and human disturbance resulting from mining activities and infrastructure development, also constitute threats to some extent. Trophy hunters can purchase hunting licenses from which $1,170 USD is allocated to the government (MNE 2005).In China the species is subject to heavy poaching (Gu Jinghe pers. comm.) (Xuchang and Minghai 2007). Antlers, tendons, unborn fawns, male reproductive organs, and tails from C. e. yarkandensis fetch a high price on local markets for use in traditional Chinese medicine. Current market prices for these products are increasing rapidly. Young deer are sold as stud for deer farming projects (Gu Jinghe 1991).In Russia, the number of C. elaphus and C. canadensis harvested by legal hunting represents 8% of their populations. The quotas for legal hunting remain higher than the number actually hunted in all regions, the percentage of quotas reached for legally hunted deer were 70% for Cervus elaphus, 50% for C. c. sibiricus and 60% for C. c. xanthopygus (Mosheva et al. 2010). Major threats to the species in Russia include forest fires, illegal logging (especially of Siberian Pine) and poaching, the meat and antler velvet is used by oriental traditional medicine (O. Pereladova pers. comm.).",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

The threat of extensive planned coal, platinum, natural gas (fracking) and other mining developments over much of the Limpopo Valley and the foothills of the Soutpansberg and Waterberg mountains and the Mahabeng Plateau, could impact heavily on populations, e.g. through roosting and foraging habitat loss, noise, air and water pollution and water abstraction leading to degradation of riparian habitats. Suppression of fire together with over-grazing of cattle and game and climate change has resulted in serious bush encroachment of savannas across much of its range (e.g. the western Soutpansberg) which has been shown to have a negative effect on biodiversity generally. In the eastern Soutpansberg, afforestation and alien plant invasions have considerably altered natural habitats. Limpopo is extremely drought-prone and water-stressed and with projected climate change, since the species seems to be dependent on water sources for drinking, extreme droughts in the area have had potentially devastating effects on wildlife generally.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Both small-scale forest clearance for subsistence farming and industrial logging contribute to forest loss within the range of S. gabonensis, with industrial logging being the most significant factor in Gabon (Tyukavina et al. 2018). The spread of industrial agriculture in the African moist-forest zone, particularly oil-palm cultivation, is a growing threat (Arcus Foundation 2014). FAO (2015) reports that annual forest loss in 2010-2015 was 1.1% in Cameroon, 0.9% in Gabon, and 0.1% in Republic of Congo. Selective logging of mature forest and rotational small-scale farming are not major threats to this species because of its ability to utilize secondary forest, but it will not persist where there is large-scale conversion of forest to cropland (such as monoculture oil-palm plantation).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Recent Spatial Distribution Modelling (SDM) estimates the species’ original area of occupancy (AOO) at 345,760 km², within which only 20,611 km² of suitable habitat remains, representing what must be regarded as an irreversible loss of 96% (Ingberman et al. 2016). Deforestation has occurred largely due to an expanding agricultural frontier, cattle ranching, urbanization and development.The current population of the Southern Muriqui is believed to be less than 1,200 individuals surviving in 20 isolated, subpopulations in a mixture of private, municipal, state and national protected areas in the states of Rio de Janeiro (6), Sao Paulo (12) and Parana  (2) (Strier et al. 2017).  Of the subpopulations, one (Carlos Botelho State Park) is believed to contain between 100 and 250 mature individuals, while three (Serra dos Orgaos National Park, Serra do Mar State Park and the Legado Das Aguas Votorantim Reserve) are believed to contain between 50 and 100 mature individuals (Strier et al 2017).Hunting has been severe in past decades and continues to be a significant threat, even within officially protected areas. Since the first regional survey of the two Brachyteles species was conducted nearly 60 years ago, the extirpation of at least a dozen former populations of the Southern Muriqui is believed to have occurred (Aguirre 1971, Rylands et al. 1998, Melo et al. 2005, Nogueira et al. 2009, M.

It is also threatened by hunting; its taste is the most preferred among the native carnivores (Golden 2005). Introduced species including dogs, cats, and the Small Indian Civet (Viverricula indica) are competitors, and dogs are also likely to be predators.Deforestation and forest disturbance across the range of Spotted Fanaloka has increased significantly since 2009. R. Rajaonson (pers. comm. 2014) estimates that deforestation in eastern forest increased from 0.5% per annum in 2005-2010 to 0.94% per annum in 2010-2013. Allnut et al. (2009) estimated that in Masoala National Park, annual rates of deforestation in the study area increased to 1.27% per annum in 2011. High levels of illegal settlement in protected areas, especially around the Bay of Antongil, are linked to artisanal mining (for quartz) and logging of rosewood; hunting for food using dogs has increased greatly in these areas as a result. Some villages have seen increases in populations of between 200 and 300% (C. Golden pers. comm. 2014).Household interviews conducted by Madagasikara Voakajy (pers. comm. 2014) in the Moramanga region of eastern Madagascar in 2008-2009 suggested that 513 (31%) of 1,635 respondents interviewed in 129 villages had eaten Spotted Fanaloka in the preceding year. This is the highest rate among all the local endemic carnivores. By contrast, in Makira, hunting, including for food, appears to be less of a concern for Spotted Fanaloka than for other carnivores across the Makira landscape. Only 11 were reportedly consumed in household surveys within four villages (143 households were surveyed) from 2005 to 2011 near the Makira Natural Park. However, hunting rates were still positively associated with Spotted Fanaloka occupancy, demonstrating increased efforts in non-degraded forest where its abundance/activity is highest (Farris et al. in review a).Spotted Fanaloka appears to alter its temporal activity when human and dog activity are very high. It has strong temporal overlap with Small Indian Civet, revealing the potential for increased interactions and competition (Farris et al. in review b).Single-season landscape occupancy analyses showed that Spotted Fanaloka probability of occupancy decreases dramatically when feral cat and Small Indian Civet were present (Farris et al. in review a).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Because all remaining forests inhabited by P. rufomitratus are small and seriously threatened, the long-term survival of the species is in question.There has been considerable alteration of river flow volume and the flood cycle by five hydroelectric power dams up-river (Butynski 1995). A sixth dam, the High Grand Falls Dam, is under construction (Hamerlynck et al. 2012, Butynski and Hamerlynck 2016). The High Grand Falls Dam, the second largest dam in Africa, will be accompanied by large-scale irrigation schemes and water transfer to the ‘Lamu Port and Lamu Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor’. The establishment of this dam is expected to have additional negative impacts on the forests of the Lower Tana River and, therefore, on P. rufomitratus.One special concern is the rapidly growing human population in the region. Another is the possible annulment of the Tana River Primate National Reserve (TRPNR; 169 km²) which the High Court of Kenya ordered in January 2007. According to the Kenya Wildlife Act 2013, Section 37, change of boundaries or revocation of a National Reserve can only be published by the Cabinet Secretary and approved by Parliament. Change or revocation can only be recommended if they do not endanger any species or critical habitat. As such, it seems unlikely that annulment will occur, despite the court ruling in 2007.About 35% of P. rufomitratus occur in the TRPNR. Even with the continued existence of the TRPNR the long-term survival of P. rufomitratus is not certain, as the high level of insecurity and inadequate law enforcement in the region is expected to continue (Butynski and Mwangi 1994, 1995; Struhsaker and Grubb 2013; Wieczkowski and Mbora 2000; Butynski and De Jong 2018).According to Global Forest Watch data, Kenya's Tana River region has lost 16% of its forest cover since the turn of the century, tropical forest habitat being reduced from approximately 60,000 to 50,000 hectares. Although the annual rate of loss has remained fairly consistent throughout this period (530 ha/yr avg), it has spiked several times to more than double or triple that rate. Should the TRPNR be annulled and/or peak rates of deforestation be reached again, it is conceivable that this species could lose 80% or more of its habitat by mid-century.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In these regions, it is also actively persecuted by local people and often killed by dogs.In Argentina, extensive habitat loss/modification due to the expansion of the agriculture frontier, mining, and oil extraction is the major threat.The biggest threat to the species in Brazil is habitat loss, especially because of silviculture and agriculture expansion, as well as habitat conversion/degradation, mostly through fire. Given its rarity in Brazil, road kills are also considered a threat for some populations. In the Brazilian Pampas, predation by domestic dogs and hunting due to real or perceived conflicts, a problem that apparently has not been detected in the Cerrado yet (where it would be more incidental than widespread). A zone of hybridization between L. colocolo and L. tigrinus has been demonstrated by genetic analysis in central Brazil (Trigo et al. 2008).In Peru, it is actively persecuted as it often kills chickens of local people, and is also impacted by dogs.

This is because reasonably large populations of the species can be supported entirely within high elevation, steep, or excessively rough/rocky terrain that is used sparingly if at all by domestic livestock. Livestock does exist near P. nayaur subpopulations, and in specific situations there may be conflicts. However, in general, it appears that even relatively intensive livestock grazing does not prohibit healthy populations of P. nayaur. This is in marked contrast to livestock’s effect on some other wild species.Because access to Pseudois nayaur habitat is usually difficult and individual body-size is relatively small, market-based poaching for meat appears to be rare, at least in the northern portions of the Tibetan plateau. Locally-based, subsistence poaching has occurred frequently in recent years, and no doubt continues. However, China has recently begun implementing a new policy of confiscating all guns from nomadic pastoralists, and observations during 1998-2002 in Gansu and Qinghai provinces corroborate this (R. Harris pers. obs.). Thus, local herders now have little technology with which to poach P. nayaur for meat. International (“trophy”) hunting for P. nayaur occurs, but only in four to five designated areas in China and Nepal (and possibly in Pakistan), and in numbers too small to have substantial population impacts. It seems most likely, therefore, that human use of P. nayaur has been decreasing in recent years. International hunting (including for Blue Sheep) in China was suspended in 2006, and as of summer 2014 had not yet been re-established.An outbreak of sarcoptic mange was reported among P. nayaur in extreme northern Pakistan, and has markedly reduced abundance locally. This may yet be a cause for concern range-wide, but similar reports from elsewhere within the species’ range have not surfaced (Woodford 2003, 2006).In Bhutan, the species is not in immediate danger and numbers seem to be increasing due to the expansion of grazing areas for domestic yaks. However, heavy grazing by both species is damaging the fragile, high alpine vegetation, so Blue Sheep population trends may be reversed in the near future. In India the major threat is localized over-hunting, including that by the army in remote outposts. Within Nepal, although in some areas religious beliefs protect Blue Sheep from poaching, excessive competition from livestock grazing may cause habitat degradation in much of its natural range. In Pakistan, limited range and low numbers make Blue Sheep vulnerable to poaching and habitat loss. When access to the Shimshal valley is opened by construction of a jeep road, the species will most probably come under increased hunting pressure.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

In Panama, the species is frequently hunted and captured for the pet trade (Méndez-Carvajal 1999, Rasmussen et al. 2002). There have been attempts to introduce this species by local people in the Veraguas Province, including western Azuero, but with unsuccessful results. Saguinus geoffroyi is often road killed in areas near Parque Nacional Metropolitano (Méndez-Carvajal 2001), and Parque Nacional Soberanía (Méndez-Carvajal 2001). The main reason for population decline is urbanization in the East of Panama Provinces and loss of mangroves in the vicinity of Tocumen International Airport (Méndez-Carvajal 1999).In Colombia, it is reported that trapping and trade of this species occurs west of the Río Atrato (Defler 2004).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Otter habitat has been either drastically changed or lost, following bush clearing, deforestation, overgrazing, siltation, draining of wetlands or water extraction or denudation of riparian vegetation (Rowe-Rowe 1995, Nel and Somers 1998).In parts of their range, African Clawless Otters getting killed for skins and other body parts (e.g., Cunningham and Zondi 1991, De Luca and Mpunga 2005), or because they are regarded as competitors for food, particularly in rural areas where fishing is an important source of income, or where they are believed to be responsible for poultry losses (Rowe-Rowe 1995), and damage to young maize plants (Reed-Smith pers. comm.). Fisheries managers of the Kairezi River Protected Area in Zimbabwe blamed trout declines on otter predation and competition with trout for food, even though scat analysis revealed that only 1% of otter faeces contained the remains of trout and their diets overlapped only 17% (Butler 1994, Butler and Marshall 1996).

Throughout Cambodia, Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and southeastern China, ungulate populations are well below carrying capacity due to over hunting by humans, even within protected areas (Durbin et al. 2004). All ungulate species, except perhaps Muntjac (Muntiacus spp.) and Wild Pig (Sus scrofa), are ecologically or fully extinct across extensive parts of the region (Durbin et al. 2004). This situation will likely hinder any possibility of recovery by the region's Dhole populations, even if the other issues could be addressed. Dholes can probably persist as fragmented populations in large protected areas of Bhutan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Indonesia (Sumatra and Java) and Thailand, as long as prey numbers remain sufficient and other threats are controlled. In large protected areas in southern and central India, Dhole numbers are stable where prey densities are high. In northeastern India, prey depletion is contributing to the decline of Dholes in the region (Gopi et al. 2012).Habitat loss and transformation: Habitat loss and degradation are serious threats to Dholes in southern Asia, particularly because this threat is closely associated with prey depletion and high levels of human disturbance. Although extensive areas of natural or semi-natural vegetation remain in Lao PDR and Cambodia, habitat conversion and fragmentation are proceeding unabated. In Viet Nam, very few natural areas greater than 50 km2 remain. Habitat loss and fragmentation is a major threat to protected areas in Indonesia, particularly those on Sumatra. Habitat loss is driven by several different factors, including logging, palm and rubber plantations, agriculture expansion, rural biomass extraction, livestock grazing and major infrastructure expansion (e.g., hydropower dams, irrigation projects, new highways, etc.).Persecution: Persecution of Dholes stems mainly from retaliatory killings due to livestock predation, and this factor is driving some Dhole populations towards local extinction (Lyngdoh et al. 2014). Dholes appear to be especially susceptible to poisoning of carcasses using strychnine or other rodenticides, which often are readily available to rural people in southern Asia. Consequently, unsystematic but consistent poisoning of carcasses can easily wipe out Dholes within an area, especially because the entire pack will feed on a carcass. For example, poisoning of livestock carcasses apparently wiped out Dholes from Bhutan in the 1970s and early 1980s, although this species began to re-occupy the country starting in the 1990s (Wangchuk 2004, Thinley et al. 2011). Killing of Dholes by poisoning livestock carcasses also has been reported in China, Nepal, India and Indonesia, and is likely is widespread in southern Asia. Poisoning campaigns also were thought to have contributed to the extirpation of Dholes in the countries of the former Soviet Union (Ginsberg and Macdonald 1990). Dholes reportedly have been shot by humans, as Dhole carcasses with gun-shot wounds were found near the boundary of protected areas in Thailand (K. Jenks and N. Songsasen unpubl.). Dholes are probably susceptible to non-selective snaring, particularly where this activity is widespread such as in Viet Nam, Cambodia, China and Lao PDR. In India, and possibly elsewhere, Dholes living outside or on the edge of core protected areas are particularly vulnerable to human kleptoparasitism.Disease and pathogens: Dholes are susceptible to rabies, canine distemper, canine parvovirus and sarcoptic mange among others (Durbin et al. 2004), which are usually contracted from domestic village dogs that act as reservoirs. Dholes appear to be especially susceptible to disease epizootics due their large pack sizes and high levels of amicable behaviour within packs, even among adults (Johnsingh 1982). Such behaviours likely result in relatively high intraspecific contact rates, which are conducive for disease epizootics, at least compared to other wild canids such as jackals (Canis aureus) which are more solitary. Disease epizootics may contribute to the sudden disappearance of Dholes from protected areas, and often cause severe local population fluctuations resulting in relatively small pack sizes (Karanth and Sunquist 2000, J. Kamler pers. obs.). In Cambodia, a recent outbreak of canine distemper in 2011-2012, thought to have originated in local domestic dogs, caused the near-extirpation of Dholes from protected areas in the eastern and northern parts of the country (J. Kamler unpubl.), although populations appear to be recovering; mortalities associated with canine distemper also have been observed in a protected area in Thailand (N. Songsasen and K. Jenks unpubl). The range-wide effects of diseases on Dhole population dynamics is unknown, but it is likely significant across southern Asia, and might result in an increased probability of extirpation for Dhole populations in isolated protected areas.Competition with other species: Aside from humans, the main competitors of Dholes for limited resources are Tigers (Panthera tigris) and Leopards (P. pardus). Although Dholes are much smaller in body size, packs of Dholes reportedly have killed both Tigers and Leopards, although the reverse also has been reported (Burton 1940). The dominance hierarchy between Dholes and Tigers is not clear, although Dholes likely avoid tigers especially if packs are small. Dholes appear to be behaviourally dominant over Leopards, and packs of Dholes often tree this species when they interact (Venkataraman 1995). Whether large felids can negatively affect Dhole numbers is unknown, although the exploitive and interference competition between them likely becomes more intense as prey populations are reduced by humans, possibly resulting in spatial exclusion where prey numbers are lowest. Free-ranging dogs also may compete with Dholes for limited food resources where prey numbers are low.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Since the Cape Spiny Mouse feeds primarily on the seeds of restios (Skinner and Chimimba 2005), replacement of natural vegetation by non-indigenous species may impact the species and effectively reduce its area of occupancy.

Although this musk, produced in a gland of the males, can be extracted from live animals, most ""musk-gatherers"" kill the animals to remove the entire sac, which yields only about 25 grams (1/40 of a kilogram) of the brown waxy substance. Such poaching is relatively easy to accomplish and difficult to stop using only legal means (Harris 2007).Musk deer appear to require dense vegetation, either in the form of intact forests or shrublands; thus excessive forest clearing or grazing can preclude musk deer from using such lands (Yang et al. 2003).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Ceiling collapse may kill bats outright or, more significantly, alter cave microhabitat enough to make it unsuitable. A few cave occurrences are threatened or have been reduced in quality due to commercialization for tourism. Threats to summer sites are unknown, but are likely to be moderate due to alteration of riparian habitats. Conversion of forested habitats to agricultural and residential uses has decreased the amount of preferred habitat in some areas, but the bats do make use of bridges and various other non-natural roost sites. Perhaps the most serious threat to cave-dwelling bats is human disturbance during hibernation. Very low levels of noise, light, and heat from lanterns are sufficient to awaken hibernating bats, which then expend energy moving about and deplete critical reserves of body fat. Improper gating of caves to protect bats may result in site abandonment. For example, the large colony of M. leibii at Fourth Chute Cave, Quebec, was driven out by blocking the flow of cold air (Mohr 1976). In contrast, gating of cave entrances in other locations (e.g., Aitkin Cave, Pennsylvania) has led to increases in M. leibii populations. With its small numbers and spotty distribution, isolated colonies of M. leibii are particularly vulnerable to extirpation by chance events, especially when concentrated during winter months. On the other hand, in contrast to certain other bats that assemble in vast numbers in relatively few sites, the population of M. leibii as a whole is not vulnerable to localized events. This bat tends to hibernate near cave entrances; hence it may be vulnerable to freezing in abnormally severe winters.Recently, the white-nose syndrome (WNS) is becoming the major threat to hibernating bats  in caves (hibernacula) and a number of studies have called the attention that the spread of this disease can extirpate whole caves from the distribution range for some species, including M. leibii (Alves et al. 2014).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Wind-turbine blades cause mortality through direct impact or through the pressure differential caused by the motion of the spinning blades. More research is under way to better understand bat wind-turbine vulnerabilities, but current studies suggest that bats face the greatest risk during migration from summer foraging sites to wintering grounds (tree bats) or hibernacula (cave bats) (Kunz et al. 2007, Frick et al. 2010). Model predictions for Myotis lucifugus in northeastern US predict 99% probability of functional extirpation by 2026. In addition, these bats use to inhabit attics, roofs, trees, and other areas in close proximity to humans, therefore, homeowners have spent large amounts of money trying to eradicate M. lucifugus from these areas (Fenton and Barclay 1980).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Males tend to be more vulnerable to hunting, especially by motorized hunters, because they tend to disperse away from the hill bases and high ridges apparently preferred by females (Schaller and Gu 1994, Berger et al. 2014). However, with the confiscation of weapons in most of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, poaching has declined as a threat to Yak populations. However, Wild Yaks have limited tolerance for disturbance from people and their livestock; they tend to move away from areas where livestock are herded. Increasing livestock herds and increased intensity of pasture use displaces Wild Yaks and ultimately reduces availability of Wild Yak habitat (Harris 2007).Interbreeding between domestic and Wild Yaks also presents a threat to the remaining Wild Yak populations (NRC 1983, Khan 1984, Schaller and Liu 1996, Harris et al. 1999, Smith and Xie 2008, Rawat and Sankar 2011). Diseases transmitted from domestic livestock, either directly or via other Wild species, may be an additional threat, although this has not yet been documented. Schaller and Gu (1994) documented low recruitment in a Wild Yak population in the Chang Tang Reserve in 1990. Only 6.7% of the total population sample (n=586) in the Aru basin of Chang Tang Reserve were young of that year; in the nearby Yalung basin the figure was only 5.3% (n=114). Even fewer young were recorded in 1992: only 1.0% of the population (n=315) comprised young animals and only one yearling was seen (n=225) in the Aru basin. It is unknown whether this reproductive failure was due to disease - e.g., brucellosis, which can cause spontaneous abortion - or to high levels of postpartum mortality (Schaller and Gu 1994).Where Wild Yaks have held on or increased in numbers, interactions and conflicts with domestic pastoralists have recently increased (including abducting domestic Yaks into wild herds, and in some cases, damage to humans or their property; Tsering et al. 2006). This has the potential to increase retaliatory killing (although it presently appears to be rare). In some villages of Sanjiangyuan reserve, Qinghai, however, Wild Yaks are protected for the hybridization benefits of Wild Yak bulls breeding with domestic Yak cows even though domestic cows are occasionally lost to wild herds and a domestic bull was killed (Buzzard 2011).  Future research into management techniques will hopefully reduce or eliminate the loss of domestic Yak to wild herds, and buffer zones without domestic Yak are being investigated in the Chang Tang Reserve.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Evans et al. (2013) indicated that in the Mariarano forest, north-east of  Mahajanga, the species was recorded in degraded habitats and is exposed  to hunting, habitat destruction through charcoal production, logging and  forest fires. Across the rest of its range the species is likely to be very vulnerable to these pressures as well as to hunting with dogs, and to be desired as food source by local people; so it is safe to assume that it is highly threatened. It occurs over a much smaller area of habitat than the Eastern Falanouc; much of its range is densely occupied by people. Areas of habitat are fragmented and often degraded; while the species is not restricted to primary forest, it does not occur far from such forest. Recent (post-2009) increases in illegal logging, slash-and-burn agriculture and artisanal mining in many of the areas in which this species occurs will have greatly increased exposure of the species to hunting and pressure from non-native carnivores such as feral dogs. ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Declining of population is expected at the global scale.  In Taiwan, decreasing gene flows among geographic populations with  increasing geographic distance were reported (Fang and Cheng 2011),  suggesting the species is a poor disperser. In account of the  association with forest and slow flight behavior, it is presumably  vulnerable to loss and fragmentation of forest. The expansion of road  systems could also threat the species. Two roadkill incidences are  reported from lowland in Taiwan where forest is highly fragmented by  road systems (https://roadkill.tw/).  Roost disturbances and destruction likely threaten the species. Loss of  roost sites, especially large maternity roosts, is expected to  interrupt gene flows among the nearby colonies. Light pollution might be  also a threat since individuals are observed avoiding artificial light  by cave entrance (Huang, J. C.-C., pers. obs.). In South Asia, some  populations are threatened by deforestation, generally resulting from  logging operations and the conversion of land to agriculture and  settlements especially in the Indian northeast (Molur et al.  2002). In Bangladesh, cyclones represent an additional threat to the  habitat. In Indonesia, especially Java Island, limestone mining is  become the major threat on their roosting sites (Wiantoro S, pers. obs).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

For many decades hunting with projectiles, dogs, and traps fabricated from local plant materials has been very high, for largely local use. From the late 1980s, rising throughout the 1990s, 2000s and into the 2010s, rapidly increasing affluence of Chinese and Viet Namese consumers and, to a lesser extent, those in Lao PDR has fuelled an explosive rise in urban demand for wildlife meat, including civets (e.g., Bell et al. 2004). In Viet Nam “the free market economy has resulted in feverish periods of trade in wild species nationwide, with negative impacts on biodiversity” (Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2004). In Lao PDR, the same situation has developed, largely for export rather than in-country consumption. This demand has resulted in levels of snaring probably unprecedented anywhere in the world, using durable materials (metal) linked by brushwood drift-fences. These are evidently extremely efficient in extirpating mobile ground-dwelling mammals of civet size (e.g., Coudrat et al. 2014); some areas of little-degraded forest now support negligible densities of ground-dwelling mammals of this size class and above (Willcox et al. 2014).Although such trade-driven off-take of large mammals from protected areas and such wildlife trade is unambiguously illegal in both Lao PDR and Viet Nam, enforcement is uneven and the large profits to be made hamper effective resolution of the problem. In parts of Lao PDR, trade prices for wild meat are so high and wild stocks so depleted that severe dietary problems are evident among rural hill people (i.e., those without access rights to productive fisheries) (Krahn and Johnson 2007). There is no reason to expect these hunting levels to decline until the wildlife species affected have been hunted out; larger species such as big cats Panthera, wild cattle Bos and Sambar Rusa unicolor are already widely extirpated in Viet Nam and Lao PDR (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), yet hunting continues. Some Viet Namese areas camera-trapped and discussed by Willcox et al. (2014) were almost bereft of any ground-dwelling mammals or birds bigger than rats. This is the plausible end-point for most areas holding Owston's Civet.By contrast, Owston's Civet seems to be fairly resilient to long-standing hunting methods and intensities, judging by the numbers that were and still are camera-trapped in in Viet Nam's northern highlands (Swan and O'Reilly 2004, S. Swan pers. comm. 2004, B.M. Rawson pers. comm. 2014). In contrast to Owston's Civet, many other hunting-sensitive species in these areas were or are already extirpated or reduced to numbers so low as to evade detection. This area has no or negligible trade-driven operation of metal snares in long lines; this lack is typical of Hmong-dominated northern highland areas (J. Tordoff pers. comm. 2014). Most hunting for mammals of civet-size and over in these areas is active, with projectiles and with dogs, rather than by passive trapping; and it is by day (B. Long pers comm. 2014). The nocturnal, solitary, generally inconspicuous habits of Owston's Civet evidently facilitate its survival in such areas; its dens must be in areas not readily found by dogs.Habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation have affected large areas of Owston’s Civet range (Schreiber et al. 1989), particularly in Viet Nam and increasingly in Lao PDR. Habitat fragmentation magnifies the impact of hunting on populations, particularly when roads are built into areas of, until then, limited accessibility. Vehicle access makes the harvest of a whole host of mid-price marketable materials such as civet meat economically viable where previously the labour investment of carrying heavy loads long distances restrained off-take in those areas to high-value products and what was required for living off the land during the process. An ongoing massive expansion of the road system in Lao PDR, in part related to large infrastructure construction such as dams and mines (e.g., Sivilay et al. 2011, W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2014), is likely to bring most of the Lao areas holding Owston's Civet within close-enough range of vehicle access that general wildlife meat extraction is economically feasible. This is already the case for most of the Viet Namese areas.The exceptions to this grim assessment include karst massifs (into which road building is rarely economically viable), montane areas inhabited by people who disdain snaring, and any protected areas which develop effective enough management regimes before the species is extirpated. While there are Owston's Civet records form karst, densities within such landscapes are unknown, as is the degree to which the species depends upon tall forests there (themselves rather patchy in occurrence in karst landscapes). The extent to which industrial snaring will spread into hill areas already largely depleted of animals larger than civets (by day-time shooting and hunting with dogs), notably large areas of the northern highlands, is unclear; if some such areas do not start to deploy it (for various reasons, such as ongoing remoteness from road networks, or the cultural predispositions of the inhabitants), these areas will also be important havens to Owston's Civet.The adaptability of Owston's Civet to non-hunted degraded and fragmented areas is unknown, but so long as snaring remains uncontrolled, is moot.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In Southern Africa, the main perceived threats are habitat loss and conversion of land for human development, and illegal hunting. In West Africa, the main threats are habitat loss due to increasing human populations and human-wildlife conflict. In Eastern and Central Africa the main threats are habitat loss through rapid conversion of land for farming and increasing human populations, drought, illegal hunting for meat and hide, and armed conflict throughout unstable regions.Some of the highest human fertility rates in the world (>4%) occur in countries where Giraffes are present. Natural habitat changes from weather irregularities result in situations generating human movement, sometimes into protected, or semi-protected, areas. Drought conditions have become more common and increase the prospects of bush fires, loss of habitat, and human population movements. Substantial human population migration also characterizes regions and areas with military operations in giraffe habitats. In some countries (e.g., Namibia, South Africa) the hunting of Giraffes is legal, but Giraffe population sizes there are increasing; in other countries (e.g., Tanzania) the poaching of Giraffes is associated with declines in Giraffe population size. Habitat fragmentation and degradation are probably the most widespread and greatest threats to African wildlife, including Giraffes, often arising as a consequence of mineral extraction and/or habitat conversion to agricultural crops.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Killing due to human-bear conflicts is an additional threat, although less obvious in its impact.  Active trade in wild Sun Bears and their parts (Foley et al. 2011, Burgess et al. 2014) is one of the two most serious threats to Sun Bear populations. Commercial poaching of Sun Bears was reported by regional experts in the Bear Specialist Group to be a moderate to major threat in all range countries except Brunei, for which there are no data (see also Meijaard 1999, Nea and Nong 2006, Nguyen 2006, Htun 2006, Tumbelaka and Fredriksson 2006, Wong 2006, Krishnasamy and Shepherd 2014). In Thailand, local hunters in one area estimated that commercial poaching reduced the abundance of Sun Bears by more than 40% in 20 years (Steinmetz et al. 2006). Poaching pressure is increasing within some Thai Protected Areas, based on encounter rates of poaching signs and poachers (Steinmetz and Ngoprasert, unpubl. data), though bears are not usually targeted as much as other species. In northeastern India, where Sun Bear populations occur naturally at low densities, bears are still caught and poaching is said to have reached ""critical"" levels (Chauhan and Singh 2006, Sethy and Chauhan 2012). In southern Lao PDR, sign surveys indicate that Sun Bear populations have been reduced to extremely low levels relative to other sites in Southeast Asia, with declines attributed to historically high poaching levels (Scotson 2012).  Of major concern is a widespread trend of wildlife snaring throughout much of the Sun Bear range. In northeastern Lao PDR, hunters use a snaring method that specifically targets bears and threatens to wipe out local populations (Scotson and Hunt 2012). Large and small mammal snares were detected in numerous protected areas throughout the county. Although not always specifically targeting bears this represents a major ongoing threat (Scotson and Brocklehurst 2013). Farmers affected by wildlife crop damage frequently set snares around the perimeter of crop fields (Fredriksson 2005), and in some instances catch bears (Hunt and Scotson 2011, Scotson et al. 2014). In Peninsular Malaysia and Indonesia camera traps increasingly record bears with missing paws (apparent snare injuries) and in a radio collaring study in Peninsular Malaysia, three out of five captured Sun Bears had missing paws (Cheah 2013), indicating high snaring pressure using cable snares.  Enforcement of domestic and international wildlife laws is severely lacking in most cases and is failing to deter illegal bear trade (Shepherd and Nijman 2008, Foley et al. 2011, Burgess et al. 2014). Low risk of being prosecuted and high potential profits mean that the incentive to poach bears is very high. The value of bear parts on the illegal wildlife market has increased notably over the past two decades (Livingstone and Shepherd 2014).  Other motivations for killing bears include preventing damage to crops and livestock (Fredriksson 2005, Scotson et al. 2014, Wong et al. 2014), subsistence use such as wild meat consumption (Krishnasamy and Shepherd 2014), and fear of bears near villages. The rapid loss and fragmentation of forests across the Sun Bear range may bring bears closer to humans and thus increase the likelihood of human-bear interactions (Fredriksson 2005). In Lao PDR, where bear crop raiding occurs annually in many parts of the country, farmers showed a general reluctance to report crop raiding events to management authorities and may be more inclined to hunt bears that enter fields instead of seeking non-lethal mitigation methods (Scotson et al. 2014). Incidences of sun bears attacking humans are rare and usually result as an act of self defence—under normal circumstances, Sun Bears avoid humans.  As Sun Bears are a forest dependent species, population declines are likely to be associated with deforestation rates. Deforestation increased dramatically during 1990-2005 and in recent times Southeast Asia has experienced the highest annual rate of forest cover change in the world  (Sodhi et al. 2004, 2010; Miettinen et al. 2011; Margono et al. 2012, 2014; Dong et al. 2014). Some estimates project extremely high loss of natural forests and of biodiversity of up to 75% and 85% respectively by 2100 (Sodhi et al. 2004, 2010). Rate of forest loss is not uniform throughout the range, however, with some discrepancies among published estimates of forest lost due to varying analytical techniques (Dong et al. 2014).  Analyses by Stibig et al. (2014) indicated that Southeast Asia lost 11.9% of its forest cover during 1990-2000. The Sundaic region (Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei) experienced the highest rate of loss (Miettinen et al. 2011; Margono 2012, 2014; Sodhi et al. 2014); Stibig et al. (2014) calculated 13% of forest was lost during 1990-2000, and Miettinen et al. 2011 estimated a further 9.9% lost during 2000-2010. By 2012, primary forest loss in Indonesia was estimated to be double that in Brazil (Margono 2014). Hansen et al. (2009) estimated that in Sumatra and Kalimantan combined, 23.5% of total forest was lost from 1990-2005, with loss of lowland forest alone more than 40%. Brunei seems to be impacted the least, although deforestation and forest degradation are still evident (Bryan et al. 2013).  Deforestation in the Sundaic region is largely attributed to extensive clear-cutting for plantations (i.e., oil palm, rubber), unsustainable logging practices (Brown et al. 2005), legal and illegal logging, and forest fires (Meijaard et al. 2005, Tumbelaka and Fredriksson 2006, Wong 2006, Wong and Linkie 2012). Conversion of natural habitat to oil palm plantations is most extensive on Borneo and Sumatra (Miettinen et al. 2011; Wicke et al. 2011; Margono et al. 2012, 2014). Protected areas are not exempt from deforestation; 40% of the forest lost in Indonesia during 2000-2012 was lost in areas where logging is restricted (i.e. national parks and protected forests, Margano et al. 2014), and in Kalimantan alone, 56% of protected lowland forests were cleared from 1985-2001 (Curran et al. 2004).  Human-caused fires throughout the Sundaic region are also diminishing habitat quality and quantity for sun bears, especially in Malaysia and Indonesia. These fires are more extensive during El Niño-related droughts. Between 1997-2006 a total of 16.2 million ha of Borneo’s landmass (21% of total land surface area) were affected by fires (Langner and Siegert 2009). On Borneo, periods of prolonged drought have disrupted fruiting patterns (e.g., Harrison 2000), which in combination with reduced habitat availability due to clearing for agriculture, logging and fires, resulted in starvation among sun bears, even in protected primary forest areas (Wong et al. 2005, Fredriksson et al. 2007).  Given the Sun Bear’s affinity for primary and relatively mature, heterogeneously structured forests, along with its strongly frugivorous diet, such forest loss and fragmentation will exert significant effects on the bear’s regional and global populations along with its genetic and demographic structure and viability (Augeri 2005). Based on deforestation rates and increasingly fragmented range, and evidence of increasing trade of bears and their parts, it is likely that many isolated populations face a real threat of extirpation.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The construction of roads, expansion of cities and industrial activities are destroying and fragmenting tahr habitat.In northern Oman an increase in mineral mining is a growing issue which is likely to threaten and damage valuable habitats, particularly in Al Batinah and Al Buraimi.The Hajar Mountains has a large and growing domestic goat Capra hircus population, estimated at 1.8 million in 2016. Domestic goats compete directly with Arabian Tahr for limited food resources, and larger numbers of goats at a site is related to the decline and expatriation of tahr (Ross et al. 2017).  Disease transmission from domestic goats to Arabian Tahr is a potential threat. Though there is little evidence of this happening, the large overlap in their habitat preferences means it is very likely.Despite legal protection, poaching of tahr does occur, as indicated by periodic prosecutions. The overall impact of poaching on the tahr population is difficult to quantify. The lack of enforcement of anti-poaching is also an issue.Habitat fragmentation is a major issue for the species, several populations are now isolated due to development of the surrounding landscape. The Jabal Hafeet tahr population and the southeastern tahr populations are most probably isolated from northwestern tahr populations.Lack of awareness amongst local people of the status of the Arabian Tahr (as an endemic and endangered species) results in decisions being made without due consideration of the impacts on the welfare and survival of this unique and regionally important species.Groundwater supplies in the Hajar Mountains are experiencing a sharp decline (Al-Charaabi and Al-Yahyai 2013), this will negatively affect perennial water pools on which the tahr depends.We expect climate change to have a major impact on the species due to an increase in extreme and average temperatures (Alsarmi and Washington 2011), decreases in rainfall (Al-Charaabi and Al-Yahyai 2013), and the resultant changes in habitat quality and composition. As the tahr’s distribution is limited to a single mountain range, and it already occurs in the upper elevations of this range, there is little scope for adaptation to climate change by dispersal or upward movement.  As most Arabian Tahr populations are simultaneously exposed to multiple threats, cumulative impacts are a major issue. The majority of tahr populations are concurrently exposed to habitat disturbance and fragmentation, competition and disease transmission from domestic goats, poaching and the effects of climate change. ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In India, Himalayan tahr is sometimes hunted for meat, and there is apparently significant competition with livestock for summer grazing in some areas. Nevertheless, many areas of prime tahr habitat are sufficiently isolated, rugged and seasonally snow-covered, that the degree of disturbance, livestock grazing and habitat alteration by humans is minimized. In Nepal, threats come from an expanding human population and accompanying increases in livestock, habitat loss, poaching and access. As a result of these factors, tahr populations are becoming increasingly isolated.

The species is subject to widespread exploitation for bushmeat and use in traditional medicine and is regularly recorded in bushmeat markets (Colyn et al. 1987, Bräutigam et al. 1994, Fa et al. 1995, Bowen-Jones 1998, Ayeni et al. 2001). Colyn et al. (1987) found that this species comprised one-tenth of the total number of pangolins (~100) on sale as bushmeat in rural areas around Kisangani, Democratic Republic of the Congo. In 2004, Giant Pangolins contributed 5,019 kg in terms of harvested biomass (including either whole animals and/or animal parts) from five markets monitored in Gabon, compared to 2,053 kg for White-bellied Pangolins (Phataginus tricuspis) and 335 kg for Black-bellied Pangolins (P. tetradactyla; Kingdon et al. 2013). Market surveys across range countries have revealed the price of Giant Pangolins has increased substantially over the past two decades with Mambeya et al. (2018) recording a 211% price rise (compared to a 73% rise in the price of arboreal pangolins) between 2002 and 2014 in Liberville, Gabon. Further, while Giant Pangolins were not recorded among the 18 most commonly traded species between 2002 and 2006, a 2014 study revealed they were the seventh most traded species forming 3.6% of all carcasses sold. Ingram et al. (2018) concluded that prices rose 5.8 times across central Africa between 1993 and 2004 , estimating  that 0.4-2.7 million pangolins were harvested every year in Africa during this period including 100,000 Giant Pangolins per annum. In Nigeria numbers of Giant Pangolins for sale in bushmeat markets have increased since 2003 as White-bellied Pangolins become harder to source (D. Soewu, unpubl. data). Figures from bushmeat markets are likely to underestimate the actual offtake: Fa et al. (1995) noted that survey records of Giant Pangolin meat in the markets of Bioko were misleading as only 10% made it to market. Similarly, in Liberia, only 25% of the harvest is sold, as local hunters preferred it to other species, while harvest rates in six communities adjacent to Sapo National Park were found to be unsustainable (Kingdon et al. 2013). The breakdown of taboos protecting the species has led to increased hunting pressure in some areas. For example, local protection afforded by totems in western Côte d’Ivoire has broken down due to refugee movements throughout the region as a result of conflicts in Liberia and Côte d’Ivoire (Kingdon et al. 2013). The species is increasingly recorded in international trade. There are no reports of trade in live specimens in the CITES trade reports between 1996 and 2011, however in 2012 50 individuals were reportedly exported from Togo to Lao PDR for commercial purposes and in 2015 100 live animals were exported from Nigeria to China for use in captive breeding according to the CITES trade data (Challender and Waterman 2017). Between 2011 and this species being listed on CITES Appendix I in January 2017, 3,268.14 kg of Giant Pangolin scales (an estimated 908 individuals) were traded internationally (Challender & Waterman 2017).The true scale of the illegal international trade is unknown, but between 2012 and 2017 6,115kg of Giant Pangolin scales were seized, equating to an estimated 1,697 individuals (Challender and Waterman 2017). These shipments were all apparently destined for markets in East or Southeast Asia. It is estimated that between 2015 and 2019 the equivalent of more than 400,000 African pangolins were trafficked either in Africa bound for Asia, or en route to East Asian countries, including the Giant Pangolin (Challender et al. 2019; D. Challender, unpubl. data). In 2018 and 2019 there were numerous very large seizures (e.g. up to and >12 tonnes of African pangolin scales) of shipments en route to Asia, and which likely included scales from Giant Pangolin. Ilegal intercontinental trade is a serious and growing threat to Africa’s pangolins, particularly as the illicit nature of the trade means that it is likely that the vast majority of such exports are not detected. This species' large size, low reproductive rate and terrestrial habits make it particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation (Kingdon et al. 2013).Habitat loss is also a threat. Past and present declines in Giant Pangolin area of occupancy (AOO) and habitat quality likely differ between West and Central Africa. West Africa has deforestation rates that are three times higher than in the Congo Basin forests (Mayaux et al. 2013), with some countries having lost up to 98% of their natural forest cover (e.g. Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana; Achard et al. 2014; Mayaux et al. 2013; Knauer et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2017). West Africa also has higher human population densities (Tatem 2017), and smaller patches of roadless areas (Ibisch et al. 2016) than Central Africa. Annual deforestation is higher in areas with higher human population density (Mayaux et al. 2013). In 2018, the Democratic Republic of the Congo had the second highest loss of tropical primary forest in the world, while Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire ranked 1st and 2nd (of countries with >100,000 ha of primary forest) in terms of their percent increase in forest loss from 2017 at 60% and 26% respectively (World Resources Institute 2019), however true rates of loss are imperfectly known.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

This musk forms the basis for many perfumes, and is highly valued for traditional medicines (Wemmer 1998). Each male produces only around 25 g of musk (Dulamtseren et al. 1989, Tsendjav 2002). Although this musk can be extracted from live animals, most ""musk-gatherers"" kill the animals to remove the entire sac.Illegal, unsustainable hunting for musk is the principal threat to this species. An estimated 25,000 adult males were killed through harvesting and illegal hunting between 1990 and 2001 (Homes 2004). As hunting is often indiscriminate of sex and age, four to five Siberian Musk Deer are estimated to be killed per musk-pod harvested (Green 1987). As cheaper, synthetic alternatives for making perfumes are becoming more popular, use of musk in the perfume industry is decreasing, but its value for cardiac, circulatory and respiratory traditional medicines remains high. During the 1970s, the international market value of musk reached up to US$45,000 per kg. Between 1995 and 2001, the number of traders in musk increased six-fold, following a similar increase in the market price of musk-pods (Zahler et al. 2004). Resource extraction such as mining is not causing a substantial loss of habitat at present, but the resulting human disturbance from this activity does constitute a threat. Habitat fragmentation may also threaten the species (Tsendjav and Bujinkhand 2000).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In general, argali appear to be extremely intolerant of human disturbance (Fedosenko 1999, Namgail 2004, Maroney 2006, Namgail et al. 2007, Harris 2007, Schaller and Kang 2008.) These threats appear to vary little among argali populations, even though habitats vary.In Afghanistan, poaching is generally considered to be a continuing threat to argali, the presidential ban on hunting notwithstanding. Weapons are not uncommon in Afghanistan.In China, poaching has been considered to be a substantial threat (Wang et al. 1997, Schaller 1998). In the mid-1990s however, a nationwide effort to confiscate guns from pastoralists substantially reduced the weaponry available for poaching. This, together with continued efforts to publicize the national law prohibiting killing protected species, appears to have reduced poaching during the last decade or so. At the same time however, efforts to regularize and sedentarize pastoralists generally increased habitat conflicts, because pastoralists typically intensified their use of productive grasslands preferred by argali, thus displacing them (Harris 2007). Some of the strongest data suggesting interference competition from livestock as a limiting factor for argali comes from Ladakh, India, where Namgail et al. (2007) documented a group of argali shifting their habitat preference toward escape terrain and away from preferred foraging areas when livestock were present.As elsewhere, livestock grazing and poaching were considered the principal limiting factors to argali in Kazakhstan by Fedosenko (1999b). There is general consensus that habitat conditions for argali improved after Kyrgyzstan’s independence in 1991, due to the collapse of the state-supported livestock sector and consequent reduction in grazing pressure in the Tian Shan and Pamirs (Farrington 2005). It is unclear whether relatively low livestock density near the Chinese border will continue. Poaching and competition with livestock are also considered threats in Kyrgyzstan (Weinberg et al. 1997). After independence in 1991, the number of domestic sheep herded into argali habitat declined dramatically, which likely had a beneficial effect. However, since 2000 there have been informal reports that livestock numbers have again risen. The main threat facing argali in Mongolia is poaching for subsistence (meat) and increasingly for their horns, which are increasingly being used as substitute horn in traditional Chinese medicine (Mallon et al. 1997, Reading et al. 1997, 1998, 1999, 2001, Amgalanbaatar 2002b). Also important are the impacts from local, nomadic pastoralists who displace argali, whose livestock feed on the same forage as argali, and whose dogs chase and even kill argali (Mallon et al. 1997, Reading et al. 1997, 1998, 2003, 2005, Wingard 2005, Amgalanbaatar et al. 2006). More minor and localized threats include unsustainable trophy hunting (Amgalanbaatar 2002a, Zahler et al. 2004, Wingard and Zahler 2006) and habitat loss resulting from rapidly increasing resource extraction (i.e., mining) (Reading et al. 1998, 1999, 2001, 2005). Subsistence poaching by miners general represents a greater threat than actual mining activities, but this may change as the number of mines continues to grow rapidly. These threats remain important due to poor or non-existence law enforcement throughout most of the range of the species in Mongolia. Very little money from trophy hunting currently supports conservation activities in Mongolia (Amgalanbaatar et al. 2002a, Wingard and Zahler 2006).In Pakistan, in addition to disturbance from livestock (grazing in Khunjerab remains legal; Knudsen 1999, Khan and Khan, n. d.), increased access to the area through the Karakoram Highway is believed to have increase poaching pressure (Hess et al. 1997).Unlike in Mongolia, domestic livestock herds in the Russian Altai were reported has having declined during the 1990s (Paltsyn 2001), providing a potential opportunity for expansion of the protected area network in the Altai-Sayan area. In Uzbekistan, poaching represents the main threat facing Severtzov’s argali, which continues to occur even within protected area (N. Beshko pers. comm.). The second major threat to Severtzov’s argali is a loss of habitat and competition with domestic livestock for forage.  Finally, inbreeding and harsh climatic conditions represent threats for the very small, isolated populations in the Aktau, Tamdytau, and Malguzar Mountains (N. Beshko pers. comm.).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Public concern for the species is high. There are management problems with many populations; remnant populations living at high densities in isolated patches of habitat are at greatest risk (Martin et al. 2008). Effective management of some of the threats on the mainland could lead to excessive abundance and result in pest problems similar to those occurring on Kangaroo Island and in parts of Victoria.The overall distribution of Koalas has been reduced since European settlement. This decline was primarily due to disease, bushfires, and widespread habitat destruction in the early decades of the 20th century. Commercial harvesting also took place across the range towards the end of the 19th century and early 20th century (large numbers, running into the millions, were killed for their pelts for a large export industry in Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland). This was banned in Victoria in the 1890s, and it continued sporadically (and under regulation) in Queensland until 1927 (Hrdina and Gordon 2004). There is no evidence, however, that the early spate of commercial harvesting had any long-term impact on the overall population. Climate change is likely to have severe consequences for this species (Adams-Hosking et al. 2011a,b, 2012).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Because of this habitat specificity, the major threat to the species is loss and degradation of habitat caused by conversion to other uses (e.g., development and agricultural use) and insufficient management (e.g., fire suppression) (FWC 2013). In addition to habitat loss and degradation, communities are also becoming increasingly fragmented and isolated (FWC 2013).  Dependence of the species on gopher tortoise burrows as sites for their own burrows (Jones and Layne 1993) leaves the species vulnerable to the decline of gopher tortoises in some habitats (FWC 2013). Red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta) may be a predatory threat to the Florida mouse (FWC 2013). Free-ranging domestic cats (Felis catus) may be another introduced predator (Loss et al. 2013).Impacts from climate change may produce further challenges for the conservation of the Florida mouse. At this time, potential impacts from climate change are not well understood; therefore, identification of appropriate management strategies is not readily possible (FWC 2013). The vulnerability of Florida mouse populations to climate change will depend on the degree to which the Florida mouse is likely to experience harm from stressors produced by changes in large-scale climatic drivers (FWC 2013). Vulnerability will be a result of multiple variables including the intensity and duration of the climate changes, the innate sensitivities of the Florida mouse to those changes, and, ultimately, the capacity of the Florida mouse to adapt to the changes that occur (FWC 2013). ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Between 2000 and 2010, the mean annual rate of deforestation for Borneo was 3,234 km² per year (Gaveau et al. 2014). Assuming a similar deforestation rate in the future, 32,000                  km² of forest could be lost by 2020; 129,000                  km² by 2050 and 226,000                  km² by 2080 (Wich et al. 2015). In the early 2010s, only 22% of the current Bornean Orangutan distribution was located in protected areas (Wich et al. 2012). Approximately a third of the entire Bornean Orangutan range was in commercial forest reserves exploited for timber, and about 45% was in forest areas earmarked for conversion to agriculture or other land uses. A business-as-usual scenario, whereby non-protected forests would be converted along the lines of current development plans, will result in the loss of more than half of the current orangutan range on the island of Borneo in the next 50 years or so.Illegal hunting. Illegal killing of Bornean Orangutans is a major cause of their decline. Recent interview surveys conducted in Kalimantan revealed that several thousand individuals are killed every year for meat consumption, as a way to mitigate conflict, or for other reasons (Davis et al. 2013). Overall Bornean Orangutan mortality rates in Kalimantan seem to significantly exceed the maximum rates that populations of this slow-breeding species can sustain (Marshall et al. 2009, Meijaard et al. 2011). If hunting does not stop, all populations that are hunted will decline, irrespective of what happens to their habitat. These findings confirm that habitat protection alone will not ensure the survival of orangutans in Indonesian Borneo, and that effective reduction of orangutan killings is urgently needed.Fires. Fires occur in Borneo on a yearly basis and are responsible for significant forest loss with dramatic results for certain orangutan populations. For example, 90% of Kutai National Park was lost to massive fires in 1983 and 1998 and its Bornean Orangutan population was reduced from an estimated 4,000 individuals in the 1970s to a mere 600 (Rijksen and Meijaard 1999); over 4,000                  km² of peatland forest in southern Kalimantan was burnt to ashes in six months of 1997–1998, resulting in an estimated loss of 8,000 orangutans. In 2015, more than 20,000                  km² of forest were lost to fires, which resulted in hundreds (or more) of additional orangutan deaths.Habitat fragmentation. With the current scale of habitat exploitation and forest conversion to other types of land uses in Borneo, only a small percentage of current orangutan habitat will remain undisturbed by infrastructure development by 2030 (Gaveau et al. 2013). Several orangutan PHVAs have shown that Bornean Orangutan populations of fewer than 50 individuals are not viable in the long term (Marshall et al. 2009), and that many small populations will go extinct unless they are actively managed (Bruford et al. 2010).Lack of awareness. A recent study suggested that 27% of the people in Kalimantan did not know that orangutans are protected by law (Meijaard et al. 2011). Campaigns to effectively inform the public and encourage rural people to support the principles of environmental conservation and be actively responsible for the management of their resources are therefore a crucial requirement for successful orangutan conservation.Climate change. Spatial models point to the possibility that a large amount of current orangutan habitat will become unsuitable because of changes in climate (Struebig et al. 2015). Across all climate and land-cover change projections assessed in a recent analysis, models predicted that 49,000–83,000                  km² of orangutan habitat will remain by 2080, reflecting a loss of 69–81% since 2010. This projection represents a three to five-fold greater decline in habitat than that predicted by deforestation projections alone. A major reduction in the extent of suitable orangutan habitat can be expected. However, core strongholds of suitable orangutan habitat are predicted to remain to the west, east and northeast of the island where populations of P. p. wurmbii and P. p. morio are found.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

It is inferred that this threat is pertinent to the species  across its geographic range where farming is practiced. Smith et al.  (2005) also identified negative associations with predation and  precipitation in respect to abundance. However, ""field size,  temperature, precipitation, and hunting had no effect on density  throughout Europe"" (Smith et al. 2005). In Greece, Spain, France  and Denmark, the restocking of hares from other regions or countries to  complement hare densities for hunting has been identified as a threat to  regional gene pools (Mamuris et al. 2001,  Schai-Braun and Hackländer 2016). This issue has also been identified as  a concern for the Cantabric population in Spain (Palacios et al.  2004). Disease is an additional threat to the European Hare and several  have been identified as the principle sources of mortality (Lamarque,  Barrat and Moutou 1996). These diseases are European Brown Hare Syndrome  (EBHS), Pasteurellosis, Yersiniosis (Pseudo-tuberculosis), Coccidiosis  and Tularaemia (Lamarque et al. 1996, Lavazza and Cooke 2018).Genetic  diversity of the European Hare in the North Rhine-Westphalia region of  Germany indicates that hare populations still retain sufficient  diversity (Fickel et al. 2005).  However, it is cautioned that restricted gene flow could eventually lead  to allelic fixation and inbreeding depression within populations that  become isolated (Fickel et al. 2005).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Fires due to deliberate burning to create savannah for feeding cattle, as well as accidental due to the dry nature of the forest are also a major cause of habitat loss in some areas. Although hunting is both illegal as well as fady (taboo) to several of the tribes living within its range (e.g., Antandroy, Mahafaly), it is nevertheless hunted for food by other tribes (e.g., Sakalava) and by immigrants to the region. In the Isalo region, this lemur is known as “sifaka-bilany” (“sifaka of the cooking pot”), but it is unclear whether this is because of its popularity as a food item or because of the sooty black appearance of individuals from this part of the species’ range. Populations are also genetically impoverished in terms of heterozygosity in some areas (Mittermeier et al. 2010, and references therein).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

They include habitat modification, lethal pest control, hunting for food and trade, heat related mortality, dispersal of camps, entanglement in barbed wire fences and backyard drape netting, and electrocution on powerlines.In Indonesia, this species is sold in North Sulawesi, particularly near Manado. The species is now locally extirpated in North Sulawesi, and hunting has expanded into other provinces of Sulawesi to meet local demand. Hunting is a serious threat to population persistence, as current levels of trade are unsustainable (Sheherazade and Tsang 2015). Hunters also noted a decline in population size (Sheherazade, pers. comm.), which requires further study to corroborate.In New Guinea, hunting for food and habitat modification are probably the greatest threats (T. Leary pers. comm.).As this species expands its range southwards in Australia it is increasingly exposed to days of extreme temperature that can lead to high rates of mortality, particularly in young (Markus et al. 2008, Welbergen et al. 2008, J. Welbergen pers comm). The frequency of these mortality events is likely to increase with climate change (Welbergen et al. 2008). In January 2014, approximately 46,000 animals in 52 camps died during an extreme heat event in South-East Queensland, representing approximately 50 percent of the population present at the time (J.

Especially damaging is the use of open pit mining of iron, nickel, and gold—a practice that is expanding in some areas of the species range. A mining ban is in place, but legal concessions gave 13 mining companies the right to ignore the mining ban, resulting in more logging activity and removal of protection to previously protected forests.

Targeted hunting at roosting sites may be a major threat to the species (approximately 10,000 bats may be harvested per year on Bougainville, S. Hamilton pers. comm). The human population on Bougainville and Buka is estimated at 200,000 people, and could potentially lead to an increase in opportunistic hunting. In Solomon Islands the level hunting pressure varies regionally. On Western Province islands where Seventh Day Adventism is the predominant religion, Solomons Flying Fox is rarely hunted. In other locations in it appears to be hunted regularly, but the absence of firearms precludes large numbers being taken (T. Lavery pers. comm.). Some animals are hunted for their teeth for use in customary shell money, but this is probably not a major concern (T. Leary and T. Lavery pers. comm).There were major die-offs of populations of this species on Bougainville and Buka in the 1980s, the cause is unknown, but it may have been related to disease or environmental factors such as temperature increase. There continue to be reports of periodic die-offs of large numbers of individuals (S. Hamilton pers. comm).Bonaccorso (1998) considered the ongoing and rapid logging of the Solomon Islands to be a significant threat. The islands of Isabel, Choiseul and New Georgia have, and continue to be, heavily logged, and the island of Malaita has the highest human population in the Solomon Islands (T. Leary pers. comm).Cyclones and other storms may have a significant impact on this species. The population on Malaita Island was decimated by a cyclone in the 1990s (Flannery 1995).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In northwest Europe, habitat change is likely to have been amongst the major causes of declines, the conversion of woodland and small-field landscape to large-scale agricultural land being particularly damaging. While declines elsewhere, particularly in eastern Europe, may currently not be so marked, the loss of cultural landscapes in those countries as they move towards western-style economies may have significant effects in the near future. The use of pesticides has been a recognized threat to the insect food, particularly where these have been directed against the larvae of favoured food items, such as melolonthid beetles, larvae of noctuid moths or crane-flies. Favoured prey may be affected secondarily by pesticide use, such as the loss of dung fauna from the use of persistent anti-parasitic drugs (avermectins) on cattle. Populations in caves and other underground habitats have suffered from increased disturbance (for example by tourist visits to caves). In buildings, colonies may be affected by human intolerance, renovation work or the application of pesticides, such as some of those used for the remedial treatment of timbers (Hutson et al. 2001).In South Asia, this species is threatened by deforestation, generally resulting from logging operations and the conversion of land for agricultural and other uses.

Its range is within 45 minutes of one of the world’s largest  cities (Mexico City) and urban expansion has resulted in habitat loss  (Fa and Bell 1990), which is ongoing. Today, suitable habitat for the  Volcano Rabbit in the Ajusco-Chichinautzin Mountains covers 7,544 ha,  equivalent to only 13.68% of the landscape, including 957 patches: 293  have a minimum area of 0.25 ha and only two are larger than 1,000 ha  (Uriostegui-Velarde et al 2018). Though hunting is illegal, it continues  because of lack of local knowledge of its protected status, and lack of  enforcement (Cervantes et al. 1990, Fa and Bell 1990, Velázquez and Gopar-Merino 2018).Reduction  of habitat quality associated to the presence of pasture lands, crops,  and roads may have a stressful effect on the rabbits, as mean cortisol  metabolites levels measured in its faeces were more than two times  higher in highly degraded habitat compared to the low degraded habitat  (Rizo-Aguilar et al. 2014). Climate change is likely to have severe consequences for this species. Anderson et al.

A second significant threat is the destruction of key habitats and traditional migration routes. The recent increase in steppe fires is a further cause for concern. Extreme climatic events, pose a threat, drought in summer and severe winters, especially heavy snow or ‘dzuud’ or ‘dzut’ conditions when an ice-crust forms on top of snow and impedes access to forage. Several resulting instances of mass-mortality are known, such as the winter of 1953/54 in Kazakhstan when 80,000 animals died (Heptner et al. 1961).Saiga are susceptible to several diseases, including foot-and-mouth disease, brucellosis and others, which may also cause large numbers of deaths. There have been four recent mass-mortality events (MME). In 2010, around two-thirds of a calving aggregation of 20,000 in the Ural population died of a peracute respiratory disease with bloat, and this was followed in 2011 by a smaller die-off of several hundreds of Saiga with similar clinical signs, immediately after calving, and grazing in the exact same location as the earlier MME, suggesting a site-specific cause. Pasteurellosis was implicated based on clinical signs and bacteriology, but very little pathology was undertaken (Kock et al. 2018).In 2015, more than 200,000 Saiga died within three weeks in central Kazakhstan. The proximate cause of death, based on multiple strands of evidence, was confirmed as haemorrhagic septicaemia caused by the bacterium Pasteurella multocida type B (Kock et al. 2018). Statistical modelling suggests that there was unusually high relative humidity and temperature in the days leading up to the outbreak; temperature and humidity anomalies were also observed in two previous similar events in the same region. The modelled influence of environmental covariates is consistent with known drivers of haemorrhagic septicemia. Given the Saiga population’s vulnerability to mass mortality and the likely exacerbation of climate-related and environmental stressors in the future, management of risks to population viability, such as poaching and viral livestock disease, is urgently needed, as well as robust ongoing veterinary surveillance (Kock et al. 2018).On 22nd December 2016 the first death of a Mongolian Saiga (S. t. mongolica) was reported by herders to the local authorities in Darvi Soum in the Khuisiin Gobi. Hundreds of live and dead Saiga were subsequently observed with a PPR-like syndrome and signs.

With the imposed regulation by the government for teak plantation forests to adopt a mixed agriculture system (agroforestry system) by cultivating agricultural products in between the young teak plantations, teak plantation forests become suitable Sus verrucosus habitat. However, a 35-50 year cycle of teak forest harvest remains a threat for the availability of this habitat. In any case, there is extensive illegal logging of teak plantations, no doubt to the detriment of S. verrucosus. These animals are killed both by sport hunters and by farmers protecting their crops (Blouch 1995). Many animals are killed by poisoning (Semiadi and Meijaard, 2006). As yet unpublished reports of the recent dramatic reduction in numbers, possibly resulting in the extirpation, of S. v. blouchi, on Bawean Island have been attributed to correspondingly increased hunting pressure following the recent settlement of Christian immigrants from Sumatra; these animals having been previously left largely unharmed by the predominantly Moslem inhabitants. Competition from and hybridization with the Eurasian wild pig, Sus scrofa  has been speculated as a further threat to S. verrucosus, especially in areas where human induced habitat changes have favoured S. scrofa, though there is little direct evidence for this and the two species evidently occur sympatrically in some areas, including Bawean Island.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Habitat loss due to logging and conversion to agriculture is a major threat to bears in 9 of 18 range countries, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, and Russia. Of these countries, Myanmar stands out as it encompasses a relatively large portion (about 12%) of the global range, so habitat loss here will have a large impact on the global status of the species.  Habitat loss and degradation is most severe in the southern portion of the range. In India, <10% of the species’ range is within protected areas (PAs), and areas outside PAs are subject to development projects and extraction of wood for fuel and livestock fodder (Sathyakumar 2006, Sathyakumar et al. 2012). In Bangladesh, where forest cover is now <7% of the land area, Asiatic Black Bears survive only in small remnant patches in the east, generally near the Myanmar and Indian borders. Cambodia and Myanmar, although still well forested (57% and 48%, respectively), are third and fourth in the world in the annual rate of loss of forested area (among countries occupied by black bears; North Korea and Pakistan have higher rates: FAO 2010). Thailand has lower forest cover (<30%), but most of its remaining forests are within PAs, and three-fourths of these are occupied by black bears (Kanchanasakha et al. 2010). Forest area has recently been increasing in Viet Nam, but much of the present remaining natural forest is highly degraded from both legal and illegal lumbering (Nguyen Xuan Dang 2006, FAO 2010).  Forest area is increasing rapidly in China, which is now first in the world in terms of area gained per year. This increasing forest area stems from mandated government programs aimed mainly toward reducing flooding and erosion; the replanted trees may or may not be particularly suitable for bears. However, good forest habitat does persist in northeastern China, Taiwan, Korea, Russia, and Japan. In Japan, Asiatic Black Bear range has expanded with increasing forest area and diminishing rural human populations (Oi and Yamazaki 2006, Takahata et al. 2014).  Direct killing represents another potential threat. Local people in Nepal, for example, use meat, organs, and bile for food, for healing, to alleviate pain, or even to deter ghosts (Yadav et al. 2012). The sustainability of this practice has never been measured.  Commercial poaching is believed to be a major threat to bears in at least half the range countries, including China, Taiwan, Russia, India, and the five range countries in Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam). Commercial poaching is likely to have especially severe synergistic effects where it coincides with logging and habitat encroachment (Cambodia, Myanmar, Lao, Russia), which increase access for poachers and concentrate bears in ever smaller and fragmented pockets.  Poachers primarily seek gall bladders and paws. The market for bear paws appears to be increasing commensurate with an increasing number of wealthy people who find it within their means to indulge in this very expensive delicacy (Burgess et al. 2014). In 2013, two seizures in two months recovered parts of 81 individual Asiatic Black Bears being smuggled (from Russia) into or within China (Servheen 2013). Such seizures probably represent a small portion of the actual trade in bear paws.  The demand for these bear products has fuelled a growing network of international trade throughout Southeast Asia, fed through poaching of wild bears (Shepherd and Nijman 2008, Foley et al. 2011). Though difficult to quantify because of its covert nature, bear poaching for the wildlife trade is clearly widespread. Hunting of bears for the wildlife trade was reported in over 70% (10 of 14) of the villages interviewed in a northeastern Lao National Protected Area, facilitated by wildlife dealers from Viet Nam who comb rural areas to place orders, supply weapons and ammunition, and transport the off-take (Scotson 2010). In parts of Nepal and Myanmar near the Chinese border, Asiatic Black Bears are among the top preferred species that are hunted commercially for sale of their body parts to China (Rao et al. 2005, Yadav 2012).  It is difficult to evaluate the actual impacts of this trade on wild populations because reliable population estimates and assessments of trends of wild bear populations are unavailable (Garshelis 2002, 2006). Nevertheless, there is evidence that this commercially-driven trade in bear parts is unsustainable and therefore causing populations to decline. In Sichuan Province, which likely has the highest numbers of Asiatic Black Bears in China, bear abundance and distribution have been in steady decline according to opinions of local people, driven predominantly by illegal poaching for bear parts (Liu et al. 2009, 2011). Demand for wild bears drives poaching throughout Southeast Asia. Local inhabitants of a large Thai reserve perceived a 50% decline in Asiatic Black Bear abundance over the previous 20 years, due almost solely to commercial poaching (Steinmetz et al. 2006). Across four countries in Southeast Asia (Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Lao PDR), relative abundance of Asiatic Black Bears determined from camera trapping was half that of Sun Bears (with which they are widely sympatric) on average, indicating much lower densities (Steinmetz 2011). Notably, areas with the most depleted black bear populations are also closer to the Chinese border (Steinmetz 2011). The Asiatic Black Bear is the most highly valued species for consumers of bear parts, and seizures of bear parts in Southeast Asia are almost exclusively from Asiatic Black Bears (Shepherd and Nijman 2008).  Use of cable snares to capture wildlife is widespread in Southeast Asia, and is particularly intensive in Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Taiwan. In Lao PDR and Vietnam, 1,000s to 10,000s of snares have been removed from single protected areas within a few months (Scotson and Brocklehurst 2013; B. Robichaud, pers. comm). Intensive snaring poses a serious threat to bears because they are often caught inadvertently even if snares are targeted at other species. For example, 8 of 15 bears observed by researchers in Taiwan had missing toes or paws from snares set for wild pigs and other wildlife (Hwang et al. 2010). The recent discovery in Lao PDR of commercially-motivated snare lines designed specifically for bears (Scotson and Hunt 2012) points to increasing pressure on wild populations driven by international demand from the trade in bear parts.  The capture of live bears presents yet another threat to this species. In several Southeast Asian countries Asiatic Black Bears are routinely confiscated from people attempting to raise them as pets, possibly originating from the poaching of their mother for the gall bladder and paws. In Pakistan, several thousand bears were taken from the wild for exhibitions (referred to as bear baiting) in which individual bears (with canines and claws removed) fight with dogs. This practice was made illegal in 2001, but continues to some extent surreptitiously. More commonly now, bears are used for “dancing”.  Conflict between humans and black bears is a widespread problem that occurs across the range of the species: Iran (Ghadirian et al. 2012), Pakistan (Dar et al. 2009, Khan et al. 2012), India (Charoo et al. 2011, Choudhury 2013), Nepal (Stubblefield and Shrestha 2007), Bhutan (Sangay and Vernes 2008; Sonam Wangchuk, Wildlife Conservation Division, Bhutan, pers. comm., 2014), Lao PDR (Scotson et al. 2014), Thailand (Ngoprasert et al. 2011), China (Liu et al. 2011), and Japan (Kishimoto 2009). Human-bear conflicts have negative effects on both people and bears―they include losses to livestock, crops, and apiaries; human injuries and deaths; and killing of bears in defence or retribution. Crop raiding is often extensive especially where farm fields and orchards are close to forest, as in India, Bhutan, and Lao PDR, and large numbers of farmers have reported crop damage from black bears (Charoo et al. 2011, Rinzin et al. 2009, Scotson et al. 2014). Killing of Asiatic Black Bears in crop fields may be motivated more by the value of their parts than the protection of the crops (Liu et al. 2011, Yadav et al. 2012, Scotson et al. 2014).  Human injuries and deaths sometimes occur at tragically high rates, especially in densely settled areas with abundant bears: in Sikkim state, India, at least 25 people were killed or injured by black bears during 2008-2013 (Choudhury 2013). In Honshu, Japan, about 80 people are injured annually, including a few deaths (Japan Bear Network 2011). Such conflicts commonly give rise to negative attitudes towards black bears (Wang et al. 2006, Charoo et al. 2011, Liu et al. 2011, Sakurai and Jacobson 2011). Human-bear conflict can be a source of significant bear mortality when local people or government authorities kill bears to reduce damage; in an extreme case, over 4,000 bears were killed as pests in Japan in 2006 (Kishimoto 2009), representing a significant portion of the country’s population of black bears.  Protected areas are often too small to contain resident black bears. Black bears have large home ranges (>100 km² in some areas; Hwang et al. 2010, Chongsomchai 2013), and their wide-ranging movements may bring them near or beyond the borders of protected areas, where they are more vulnerable to poaching and more likely to come into conflict with farmers (Hwang et al. 2010, Ngoprasert et al. 2011, Choudhury 2013). The availability of natural foods also has a strong effect on whether bears roam outside protected areas. Periods of mast failure or low fruit availability can induce bears to seek human foods outside the forest (Kishimoto 2009, Ngoprasert et al. 2011). Black bear raiding of corn fields adjacent to a park in Thailand coincided with annual periods of low fruit availability, and resulted in some being killed by farmers (Ngoprasert et al. 2011).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

However, their general versatility and eclectic diet are likely to ensure their persistence despite changes in landscape and prey base. Culling may be able to reduce numbers well below carrying capacity in large regions (Heydon and Reynolds 2000), but no known situations exist where this currently threatens species persistence on any geographical scale. Red Foxes have caused considerable damage where they have been introduced; their impacts on Australian fauna has been particularly well documented; control takes place by setting baits impregnated with 1080 (sodium fluoroacetate).",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

Many of the less numerous subspecies (e.g. R. r. balcanica, R. r. cartusiana, and R. r. tatrica) are threatened by the deliberate introduction of subspecies from other geographic areas (especially R. r. rupicapra), leading to hybridisation and genetic swamping (Shackleton 1997). Human disturbance, particularly as a result of increased tourism and leisure activities in mountain areas, may also be a problem (Shackleton 1997, Jurdíková 2000). Competition with domestic livestock and introduced species such as the mouflon Ovis aries is a threat to the more vulnerable subspecies, although it is not considered to be a major problem for R. r. rupicapra. R. r. rupicapra does, however, suffer periodic outbreaks of sarcoptic mange, causing local population declines (Shackleton 1997). In 2006 a new disease, pestivirus, was first recorded in this subspecies (J. Herrero pers. comm. 2006). In general, habitat loss is not a major threat to the species, as much of its range falls within protected areas. However, habitat loss may be a problem in some areas (e.g. for subspecies balcanica in Albania) (Shackleton 1997). Because its population is very small indeed, subspecies cartusiana is susceptible to extinction as a result of stochastic demographic or environmental events (Shackleton 1997, S. Lovari pers. comm. 2006).Rupicapra rupicapra asiaticaThe main threats are poaching and competition with livestock, coupled with natural predation (Shackleton 1997).Rupicapra rupicapra balcanicaIn Albania, habitat loss is a major threat in some regions due to land demands from expanding human populations. There appears to be no competition from domestic livestock. Poaching does occur but the extent is not known. In Bulgaria, the major threat is hybridization with Alpine chamois. In Rhodope this is almost complete, and is also a potential danger at Rila. The Balkan population which has been isolated for about 100 years is still small and vulnerable, and poaching has not yet been eliminated. The majority of the populations in Rila and Pirin are not directly threatened, but neighbouring populations are potentially threatened by hybridization. Outside the protected areas, poaching remains a problem. In Greece, poaching facilitated by road developments, and predation by feral dogs are the main threats to chamois survival (Hatzirvassanis, 1991). Another serious threat is domestic livestock grazing which creates ecological competition and habitat loss, and all three threats occur both within and outside national parks (Hatzirvassanis, 1991; Tsunis, 1988). Forestry and tourist developments are the main causes of increased road construction, which in turn create access for poachers. In some areas, recreation activities may significantly disturb chamois (Adamakopoulos, in prep.).Rupicapra rupicapra carpaticaGrazing by domestic sheep in summer tends to disturb chamois causing them to be more dispersed. In some areas, high densities of these domestic animals create intense grazing pressure.Rupicapra rupicapra cartusianaMany factors threaten this subspecies, and the most important include: food and space competition with domestic livestock, red deer and introduced mouflon; hybridization with introduced Alpine chamois; over-harvesting and poaching; forestry; summer tourism and winter cross-country skiers. Rupicapra rupicapra caucasicaUntil recently, this chamois was common in the western half of the Greater Caucasus but very rare in Daghestan where they are often displaced by wild goats (Capra aegagrus). The reason for the decline in numbers in some populations, even in protected areas, is unknown, although outside of these areas, poaching related to political unrest is a major threat. In some areas, competition with domestic livestock is a problem, and competition with tur, red deer (Cervus elaphus), and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) is also possible.Rupicapra rupicapra rupicapraSarcoptic mange is a problem in Austria and will continue to be so unless measures are taken to prevent its spread. There are also concerns about the relative over-harvesting of older males (e.g. Zeiler et al., 1990, 1992). Although not threatened overall in Germany, the small sub-alpine populations are vulnerable to poaching and stochastic events, and possibly to inbreeding depression. Disturbance acts as a major threat to small populations and has caused declines in some. Unless steps are taken to reverse this threat, declines will continue and most small populations are on the verge of extinction. Even large populations face threats. Numbers in the Bavarian Alps are currently decreasing due to sharply increased harvest rates. Tourist development has also affected many subpopulations negatively (e.g., disturbance, habitat isolation). In Italy, competition with introduced mouflon may cause problems for Alpine chamois in some parts of its range.Rupicapra rupicapra tatricaMajor threats include poaching, because access to firearms is now relatively easy, and disturbance and habitat loss caused by tourists. An estimated three million people visited Tatra National Park in 1990. In Slovakia, interbreeding with animals from introduced populations of Alpine chamois threaten one of the two remaining populations of R. r. tatrica. Both populations are relatively small and their effective population sizes may make the maintenance of genetic diversity and adaptability limited over the long-term.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Hunting is universal all over Bangladesh as well as India, and may be in Myanmar also. In China, the Tibetan population could be under threat from hunting for food or non-targeted hunting, but this is not established.In some Indian locales, these animals are rare due to large scale hunting for food and because some ethnic groups believe the gibbons have medicinal properties (Gupta 2005, J. Das pers. comm). On the other hand, observations from Arunachal Pradesh (P.C. Ray pers. comm.) suggest that hoolocks are not hunted for subsistence, and may even be cherished. Density of gibbons is still high around tribal villages of several ethnic groups; the same is true in northern Myanmar. Additionally, jhoom cultivation threatens the habitats of Indian populations, some of which are relatively isolated already (Choudhury 1991). Affecting all northeastern Indian primate populations are harvesting of bamboo for paper mills, oil mining and exploration, and coal mining, which deplete habitat and cause pollution and disturbance (Choudhury 1991). Habitat fragmentation and loss are major threats in India (Kakati 2000). Small and restricted groups may not be viable because of genetic and demographic instabilities and because they are more affected by hunting pressure and habitat loss. Many small forest fragments are reported to have only one or a few gibbon groups. These have limited chances of surviving more than a few generations without translocation (Campbell et al. 2015, Das et al. 2010).In Myanmar, shifting cultivation is a major threat, and so is hunting. Although logging is restricted on the western side of the Chindwin, it is still considered a threat for this species (Geissmann et al. 2013). Political and ethnic conflicts have prevented the Myanmar government from promoting development and conservation activities effectively in areas of northwestern and central western Myanmar along the borders with India and Bangladesh. Thus, most conservation efforts have been concentrated within the range of Hoolock leuconedys.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The teeth are often pulled, resulting in infection and/or death. If animals survive, lack of teeth makes reintroduction impossible. Well-meaning rescue centres haphazardly reintroduce lorises into local forests without knowledge of their taxonomy or social needs. Sumatran populations are particularly impacted by the pet trade. There is little information available on other threats to this species. It is relatively adaptable to anthropogenic habitats, and so it might less affected by forest loss than some other primate species. Nevertheless, forest loss has been so severe in the region that it is likely to have had some negative impacts. Animals are shot as crop pests and for other reasons (Bennett et al. 1994).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Extensive habitat loss and fragmentation threaten the Javan Slow Loris throughout its range. In comparison to other Indonesian slow lorises, N. javanicus is significantly more vulnerable to anthropogenic activity due to intensive land use by humans (Thorn et al. 2009). Lack of connectivity between protected areas also poses a threat to loris populations, with every forest area containing slow lorises being effectively isolated by several km of intensely modified and unsuitable habitat. The conversion of land to agriculural plantations is correlated with a sharp decline in slow loris population over the last 10 years (Wirdateti and Dahrudin 2011).This species, like other slow lorises in Indonesia, is caught for use in the pet trade and to a lesser extent for traditional beliefs and folk medicines (Nekaris et al. 2010, Shepherd et al. 2004). Together with other loris species, N. javanicus is one of the most common protected primates found in animal markets in Java (Nekaris et al. 2008, Thorn et al. 2009). Due to their non-saltatory locomotion, their choice of sleeping sites in trees and bamboo that can be cut through and accessed, and nocturnal habits, the animals are easily caught by humans (Nekaris and Bearder 2011). The majority of the trade is to satisfy a large domestic demand, with a smaller proportion being smuggled abroad to destinations like the Middle East and Japan. The trade chain poses a perilous threat for many reasons. Conditions during transport (stuffed in boxes or sacks) and inappropriate husbandry techniques (poor diet and social housing, forced diurnal activity, excessive handling) afterwards result in large mortality rate. Slow lorises are the only venomous primates; to avoid their bites middle men or traders cut or remove teeth, a process that almost invariably leads to the animal’s death. If confiscated, reintroduction to the wild has proven difficult. Animals with no teeth are not viable candidates, and in a two-year study of 11 healthy radio-collared animals released, only two are known to have survived (Moore 2012).Hybridization poses a real threat both on Java and elsewhere. Some taxa of slow loris are known to hybridize in zoos. Javan Slow Lorises have been observed on animal markets outside Java (e.g. Medan, Bandar Lampung on Sumatra) and other Indonesian slow loris species (N. coucang, N. menagensis) have been observed to Javan markets. Due to the morphological similarity of Nycticebus spp. misidentification is rife. Furthermore, there is a general feeling that ‘if it is a slow loris, release it.’ Not only does this pose welfare risks to the individual, but also translocated individuals may harbour infections and parasites, and could potentially hybridize (Nekaris et al. 2008, Schulze and Groves 2004).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Riparian communities in the San Joaquin Valley have been  reduced to about 1% of their historical extent, are found almost  entirely within the levees of channelized streams. Most existing patches  have been extensively degraded by wood cutting, livestock, invasion of  exotic species, greater levels of flooding within levees, and lack of  natural riverine processes (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1998, U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service 2000).Principal existing threats to S.  b. riparius can be summarized in order of importance as: 1) stochastic  environmental processes, wildfire and flood; 2) additional habitat loss  and degradation due to urbanization and conversion to agriculture; 3)  increased predation from domestic and feral cats and dogs due to urban  development adjacent to existing inhabited sites; and 4) genetic and  demographic stochasticity in small populations. While all of these are  proximate threats, wildfire and flood are probably the most severe  threats to the population at Caswell MSP. A less imminent threat is  natural successional processes that are reducing habitat quality.  Because the park has multiuse objectives, and because up-stream  impoundments have greatly modified the natural flooding regime,  secondary successional patches, especially those caused by scouring  floods, are disappearing from the Park. The changes are noticeable and  may be associated with the decline in S. b. riparius within the park  (Williams and Hamilton 2002).For the South Delta metapopulation  of S. b. riparius, wildfire is a serious threat to each subpopulation,  but would unlikely affect all subpopulations simultaneously. Flooding  poses a more immediate metapopulation threat, because the entire area is  approximately at sea level or below, rivers are channelized, and there  are few or no refugia above flood level. Over the past several decades  there have been numerous breaks in levees and widespread flooding. The  most recent were in 1997, 2006, and 2011. Typically, the only areas not  flooded are built-up areas for railroads, levee tops, multilane highways  and other developed sites. Likely these areas will be inundated at some  time in the future when flooding is greater than it has been in recent  decades. Urbanization also is viewed as an imminent threat because most  of the known populations are adjacent to areas undergoing development  planning, with construction slated to begin within 1-10 years. However,  this threat may be mitigated by appropriate design and management of  conservation lands set aside for Brush Rabbits and other organisms  (Williams and Hamilton 2002).The re-introduced population on the  San Joaquin River NWR, like the populations at Caswell MSP and South  Delta, is threatened by wildfire and flood, but major conservation  actions to mitigate impacts of the flooding have been implemented at the  refuge. See below.S. b. cerrosensis from Cedros Island, off the  west coast of Baja California Sur is under intense pressure from  predation by feral dogs (Cortes-Calva et al. 2013,  Álvarez-Castañeda and Lorenzo 2016). On Cedros Island there is a  population of 2,696 inhabitants, whose main activity is obtaining salt  from the salt flats of Guerrero Negro (INEGI 2010). There are vast areas  covered with organic (lobster shells) and inorganic (glass bottles,  metal material) garbage. Additionally, feral cats (Felis sylvestris) and  feral dogs (Canis lupus) in large numbers occupy also the habitat where  S. b. cerrosensis occurs. S. b. cerrosensis was abundant about 20 years  ago, however poaching has been excessive and reduced the rabbit  population to a situation that is currently critical (Lorenzo et al. 2014).S.  b. peninsularis may be extinct or close to extinct due to anthropogenic  activities – the widespread building of infrastructure to support a  growing tourist industry, using all the water of the river for the urban  development, creating more desert areas in which the Desert Cottontail  (Sylvilagus audubonii) is more common (Lorenzo et al. 2013).S.  b. exiguus from the central desert of the Baja California peninsula has  always been rare and now may be declining due the process of  desertification in the peninsula, in which the mesic environment has  been more optimal for desert species such as the Desert Cottontail and  Black-tailed Jackrabbit (Lepus californicus).",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Many protected areas were established during the Dutch colonial period but from independence up until the 1970s they were largely under-funded and neglected. After hosting the World Parks Conference in 1982, the Indonesian government gazetted a swathe of national parks and more structured conservation planning began, funded by the World Bank and other donors. The focus was largely on the 'multi-function' national parks and much money was spent on infrastructure, some staff training and increased personnel. The 'lesser' protected areas such as ""wildlife reserves"" and ""nature reserves"" still had few staff and resources, and that has continued to the present. There was some habitat loss from protected areas through illegal logging, agricultural encroachment and other offtake, but the national parks of Java (several of which contain ideal habitat for Javan Deer and, at least into the mid 1990s, very large populations) remained remarkably intact for much of the period. During the 1980s and early to mid 1990s guns were tightly controlled and the military and police were feared and respected. The strong culture of caged bird keeping meant that hunting, including that within protected areas, was primarily for birds and some small game, through various forms of trapping, including snaring. Thus there was relatively little hunting of Javan Deer and populations were stable or even increasing. Socio-political changes from 1997 led to a reduction in the respect for the police and military and the rise of a viewpoint that protected areas were the peoples' resources and would therefore benefit from decentralised management (M. Tyson pers. comm. 2008). This policy change, which risked a ""tragedy of the commons"", has indeed led to increased habitat destruction and poaching in the past decade. The Javan Deer, as a large deer, is particularly threatened by this rapid rise in illegal hunting (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008) and also by expansion of agriculture on Java and other forms of encroachment (G. Semiadi pers. comm.; S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008.). In Java, this deer is poached with snares and dogs, but mostly with guns in the late 1990s and 2000s (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). The Javan Deer is now seen as a source of extra income and of animal protein by many local communities despite being legally protected (Semiadi 2006) and coupled with the decentralisation of conservation management decisions and actions, macro-economic fluctuations and reduced authority of The Law, this impedes control of illegal hunting (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). Poaching has reportedly reduced numbers at Baluran National Park, formerly the largest population within the native range, and more widely across Java, but data are insufficient to determine rate of decline (E. Meijaard pers. comm. 2008). Similar trends are likely on Bali. In the rest of its Indonesian range, e.g. Sulawesi, where it is introduced and thus populations are not used in assessing the Red List Category, it is also heavily hunted and there were major population declines in the late 1990s, although at least on Sulawesi the population is now in slow recovery (G. Semiadi pers. comm. 2008). Poaching of this species in its native range is for meat, medicinal products (some traded internationally), handicrafts products, and, locally, pets.During the 1980s-1990s, when poaching and land conversion were relatively well under control in Javan national parks, the chief threat to the large population of Javan Deer in Baluran National Park was loss of grazing area to invasion by the introduced tree Acacia nilotica (Leguminosae) that converts open grassland to dense thorny scrub-forest. This plant was introduced (without adequate risk assessment) as part of an attempt  to create a living fire-break around the park's grasslands, wild fire then being adjudged the major threat to the park's monsoon forests. Since that introduction, repeated cutting of the acacia has led to coppicing into very dense thickets that contain little or no grass or other herbs and are difficult for the deer to penetrate. Thus habitat loss and poaching are now serious limiting factors in Baluran National Park, and habitat loss/degradation remains a severe long-term threat to be addressed (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). Lantana camara (Verbenaceae) is also a problem in Javan Deer habitat in Baluran National Park and elsewhere on Java (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

These small subpopulations tend to be found in remnant wild areas surrounded by more extensive human development. As wide-ranging omnivores, Brown Bears are attracted to areas with available human-related foods; being large and somewhat aggressive, these bears may threaten life and property (often agricultural products) and may be killed as a consequence. Areas of high human use that attract bears may serve as significant mortality sinks (Nielsen et al. 2004, 2006). Additionally, bears living near humans may be killed inadvertently (e.g., vehicle or train collisions), poached for parts or products, or killed by people hunting for other species. Even small numbers of bears removed from small subpopulations can have adverse effects on population growth (Wakkinen and Kasworm 2004); conversely, preventing just a few deaths may avert a population decline (Wiegand et al. 1998, Garshelis et al. 2005). Where Brown Bears exist in a large, contiguous population, they are sometimes hunted for sport or killed for control purposes, and rates may sometimes be unsustainable at least over the short term (Lamb et al. submitted, McLellan 2015, McLellan et al. submitted). Estimates of sustainable exploitation are hampered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining reliable estimates of population size, natural mortality, and reproductive rates. Most countries do not have the resources to develop and implement adequate monitoring programs and sustainable management plans for Brown Bears. Moreover, even with such plans in place, illegal or unreported kill may equal or exceed the legal and supposedly sustainable kill (McLellan et al. 1999, McLellan 2015). This is apparently occurring in the Russian Far East, where Brown Bears are poached for the commercial trade in gall bladders and paws (Seryodkin 2006). In portions of Alaska, the management goal is to reduce bear populations to encourage Moose and Caribou populations to expand for the benefit of hunters (Miller et al. 2011). In addition to direct removal of Brown Bears, many other human activities (such as agriculture, plantation forestry, highways, hydroelectric and wind power developments, and human settlements) eliminate, fragment, or erode the value of bear habitat (Proctor et al. 2005, Waller and Servheen 2005, Proctor et al. 2012). Habitat fragmentation is a serious threat that isolates population units with deleterious demographic and genetic impacts (Proctor et al. 2005, 2012). With increasing human populations, the value of Brown Bear habitat is being degraded in many areas (e.g., Can and Togan 2004, Nawaz 2007), while in other areas (i.e., Turkey), fewer people are now living in rural areas and conditions are improving for Brown Bears.In Europe, four of ten subpopulations are Critically Endangered. However, the current public interest, financial investment and management actions, seem to presently secure most populations at least for their short to midterm survival. Portions of subpopulations in some countries are less secure due to lower local acceptance and correspondingly high human-caused mortality rates. Almost half of the subpopulations are currently growing, but to guarantee long-term survival, all present and potential future threats must be kept in check. The key threats for bears in Europe were identified as: habitat loss due to infrastructure development, disturbance, low acceptance, poor management structures, intrinsic factors, accidental mortality and persecution. Most threats were expected to increase in the future (Kaczensky et al. 2013).",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Throughout this species's range, there has been loss and degradation of forests through logging and conversion of forests to non-forest land-uses (Sodhi et al. 2010; WWF 2013, 2015; Gaveau et al. 2014). Forest conversion has been extremely high in the lower-altitude parts of its Sundaic range in the last 20 years (e.g. Holmes 2000, BirdLife International 2001, Jepson et al. 2001, McMorrow and Talip 2001, Lambert and Collar 2002, Kinnaird et al. 2003, Curran et al. 2004, Fuller 2004, Eames et al. 2005, Aratrakorn et al. 2006, Gaveau et al. 2014, Margono et al. 2014, Stibig et al. 2014). Protected areas are not exempt from deforestation; 40% of the forest lost in Indonesia during 2000–2012 was lost in areas where logging is restricted (national parks and protected forests; Rode-Margano et al. 2014), and in Kalimantan specifically, 56% of protected lowland forests were cleared from 1985 to 2001 (Curran et al. 2004). Lowland deforestation is now also a growing threat to populations in mainland South-east Asia (e.g. Chutipong et al. 2014, Donald et al. 2015). Choudhury (1997) noted that large-scale deforestation in Indian portions of the species’s range could be contributing to its increased rarity, because many former records come from areas where forests are now being degraded. In China, rampant deforestation and opportunistic logging have fragmented suitable habitat or eliminated sites altogether (Pu et al. 2007).Throughout South-east Asia, Binturong is hunted for its meat, for traditional medicines and as pets (Corlett 2007, Roberton 2007, Datta et al. 2008, Shepherd 2008, Shepherd and Shepherd 2010, Naniwadekar et al. 2013). In the Philippines, this species is harvested for the pet trade, and in the south of its range it is also taken for human consumption (GMA Philippines 2006). In Lao PDR, this species is among the most frequently displayed caged live carnivores and skins are traded frequently in at least Vientiane (R.J. Tizard pers. comm. to Duckworth et al. 1999, T.N.E. Gray pers. comm. 2015). Considered a delicacy in parts of Lao PDR, the Binturong is taken for food and is also traded as a food item to Viet Nam (I. Johnson pers. comm. to Duckworth et al. 1999). There is a large demand for civet meat, including Binturong, in China and Viet Nam (Bell et al. 2004, Roberton 2007).Recent camera-trapping evidence across the species’s range has made clear that the Binturong descends to the ground more frequently than had previously been thought; therefore, the threat of snaring to this species is likely to be more serious than had been assumed. Non-specific hunting of large mammals is very high across most of the species's mainland range, with industrial level cable-snaring especially prevalent in parts of northern South-east Asia. Given that the Binturong is relatively unafraid of people and is sometimes active during the day, it is often conspicuous both to surveyors (suggesting that the few encounters reflect a low population) and to hunters (thus exposing it to elevated risk) (Duckworth et al. 1999); this is supported by verbal reports from wildlife hunters in North-east India (see Naniwadekar et al. 2013). A number of national-, landscape- and survey-area-level reviews of small carnivore records in mainland South-east Asia have found Binturong to be infrequently recorded, and sometimes not at all, in relatively intensive camera-trap surveys (i.e. more than 1,000 effective camera-trap-nights) (e.g. Chutipong et al. 2014; Coudrat et al. 2014; Gray et al. 2014a, 2014b; Willcox et al. 2014: SOM T3). Although the species’s arboreality may in part explain the paucity of records, the large number of camera-trap surveys, some of which were targeted at species found in similar habitats e.g. Mainland Clouded Leopard Neofelis nebulosa, and the hunting-pressures in this region that have caused the declines in a large range of animal species, suggests that the current infrequency of Binturong records from the mainland South-east Asia portion of its range may be a genuine indication of its rarity there and that this reflects recent decline.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

However, there are many threats at a more local level, principally habitat destruction and hunting pressure, either for food, sport or in reprisal for crop damage, particularly in areas near human habitation. In Afghanistan, Hassinger (1973) cited reports of the decrease in the numbers of wild pigs in the Pul-i-Khumri District in the 1950s as a result of the draining of marshlands for agricultural purposes, and hunting by Europeans; but noted that they were still numerous in other districts where: ""they invade the fields and cause serious damage during the harvest"". In parts of Perak and Johore in West Malaysia, Diong (1973) reported that the numbers of wild pigs (S. s. vittatus) had diminished drastically as a result of increased hunting pressure, particularly for commercial purposes, and that most hunting methods, whether with guns, dogs or snares, was entirely non-selective. Nonetheless, wild pigs are still included in Malaysia's 'Agricultural Pest Ordinance, 1977', on account of their damage to a variety of crops, including sugar cane, tapioca, rice and even coconuts. Lay (1967) also remarked upon the damage to crops by wild pigs in Iran which: ""...brings great wrath upon them, usually ineffectual, from the local farmers"". In Pakistan, the expansion of the sugar cane industry in the 1960s and early 1970s brought about local increases in the numbers of wild pigs (S. s. davidi), whose depredations in the cane fields (estimated at an annual loss rate of Rs.5 million in 1978) led to the development of control measures, including the use of poison baits (Shafi and Khokhar 1985). Although actually referring to wild pigs in India, it is clear that Prater's (1971) opinion that: ""No animal is more destructive to crops and, in cultivated areas, it is impossible to make a plea for its protection"", would find popular support in many other countries. In the Ryukyu Islands, south of Japan, the endemic S. s. riukiuanus is actively regarded as an environmental pest, and bounties are paid to farmers for killing them by the Japanese Government, despite the fact that this taxon is recognized internationally as being seriously threatened throughout it extremely restricted range (see later text). In various places in Indonesia, most notably in Java, deliberate attempts have been made in the past to eradicate wild pigs altogether by means of organized shooting parties and poisoning campaigns. However, despite many thousands of wild pigs being destroyed in this way, it is clear that this has had little lasting effect on these animals which, according to Hoogerwerf (1970), have: ""remained further removed from extinction than any other species of game in Java"". This situation evidently obtains in a number of other countries, including Viet Nam (R. Ratajszsak pers. comm.) and Taiwan (K. Nowell pers. comm.), where wild pigs are reported to survive in a number of nominally protected areas where all or most of the other principal 'game' species have been eradicated by sustained hunting pressure. In these and many other (non-Islamic) countries or local communities, wild pigs often constitute the single most important game animal to subsistence and/or recreational hunters. Sport hunting accounts for about 30 to 50% of animals heavier than 20 kg in southern France, though this figure may be as high as 50 to 75% in some heavily populated countries, where hunting remains largely or wholly uncontrolled (Spitz, 1986). For example, the wild pig population inhabiting the 25,000 ha of broadleaved woodlands around Monticiano in Italy, has apparently been able to sustain its numbers despite an annual hunter-kill rate of about 50% (c. 500 animals) of the population (Devitt, 1984). According to figures produced by the Japanese Environment Agency a total of 1,279,453 (an average of 63,973 per annum) wild pigs were harvested in Japan between 1970 and 1989 (incl.), of which 1,083,858 (85%) were taken by hunters, and the remaining 195,596 were destroyed as crop pests during the closed season. The great majority of these animals are S. s. leucomystax from the main islands of Honshu, Shikoko and Kyushu, and this subspecies is evidently able to withstand high levels of harvesting to judge from contemporary reports of marginal expansions in the overall range of this subspecies (Hanai, 1982; Takahashi, 1980). Unfortunately, however, these totals do not differentiate between the numbers of S. s. leucomystax and those of S. s. riukiuanus from the three small islands of Amami Oshima, Tokuno Shima and Kakeroma Jima, which are also included in these figures. As previously indicated, the latter subspecies is declining rapidly in numbers on these islands, and on the neighbouring island of Okinawa, largely as a result of over-hunting (Barber et al. 1984, H. Obara pers. comm.). This conclusion is also borne out by official figures on the annual harvest of S. s. riukiuanus from two other islands, Iriomote and Ishigaki, in the Ryukyu chain between 1965 and 1981, which indicate a downward trend in the numbers of these animals (Yasuma 1984) and a marked increase in the amount of effort required by local hunters to obtain smaller catches (Hanai 1982). Nonetheless, according to these figures an average of 530 and 190 wild pigs were still being taken annually on Iriomote and Ishigaki, respectively; of which slightly more than 50% were killed as 'agricultural pests', i.e. mostly out of season, often with a Government bounty being paid. Moreover, it is certain that these totals are a serious underestimate - perhaps by as much as 50-100% - of the actual numbers killed, since many hunters operate without licenses and do not declare their catches (Barber et al. 1984, Yasuma 1984). Formerly, virtually all of these pigs were consumed locally but, following the restoration of electricity (and, hence, refrigeration) in 1972, commercial traders began operating on the islands, and the majority of carcasses are now exported to gourmet markets in Osaka, where they realize relatively high prices and ensure a continued demand for wild-caught meat (Yasuma 1984). Wild pigs are also susceptible to a variety of highly contagious diseases which can decimate their populations. Santiapillai et al. (1991) referred to a catastrophic crash in the wild pig population of Ruhuna National Park in Sri Lanka in 1989 owing to an outbreak of swine fever, but that population numbers had apparently recovered by June 1991. Many wild pigs are also reported to have died during an outbreak of disease in the Kanto Region on Honshu Island, Japan in 1877 (Yanagida 1913). It is possible that this was hog cholera, contracted from domestic pigs which were imported to the region at that time (Chiba 1975), and this may have been one of the factors contributing to the extirpation of S. s. leucomystax throughout the north of their range on this island. An outbreak of severe skin disease (tentatively identified as sarcoptic mange) on Iriomote, which was first noted in 1976, had spread throughout the Island by 1980, and infected up to 83% of the S. s. riukiuanus population according to data based on hunter-killed samples (Yasuma 1984).The Ryukyu pigs are also threatened by genetic contamination through contact with free-ranging domesticates. On Ishigaki Island, interbreeding with domestic pigs has been so prevalent that it is doubtful if the remaining wild stock can be considered genetically pure (Obara 1982). Moreover, it is unlikely that this problem will be confined to Ishigaki, given that the meat from wild x domestic hybrids or 'ino-buta' is popular and local farmers will continue to produce it. Indeed, ino-buta have been farmed commercially on Iriomote for many years, often in poorly controlled conditions. As a result, feral ino-buta have become established on the adjacent, smaller islands of Sotobanare and Uchibanare, and it is claimed that a number of these animals have crossed onto Iriomote at low tide; thereby posing a further, serious threat to the remaining wild stock there (Yasuma 1984, Takahashi and Tisdell 1992). Similarly, Genov et al. (1991) reported that the traditional practice of rearing 'domestic' pigs in semi-wild conditions in Bulgaria has resulted in their hybridizing with the wild boar populations in the eastern and north-eastern parts of that country, and that genetically pure wild boars now occur only in the Rila-Pirin-Rhodopes Mountains in the south of this country, where domestic pigs are not reared in the wild. The principal threat to the survival of the Monticiano population in Italy, lies not so much with the high annual hunter-kill rate but with the fact that the genetic integrity of the native population has been seriously compromised by the introduction of Central European boars after World War II, which have interbred with these animals. Indeed, the introduction of non-native wild pigs, by hunting interest groups in the belief that these were more desirable because of their larger size and reputed greater fecundity, has been so widespread in Italy that the only surviving pure-bred native stock is thought to be in the presidential reserve in Castel Porziano, near Rome (Devitt 1984).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

These factors have already resulted in the extensive fragmentation of peccary populations and its extirpation over large parts of its former range (Bodmer and Sowls 1993). The Collared Peccary (Pecari tajacu) and White-lipped Peccary (Tayassu pecari) are important resources for subsistence hunters of the Peruvian Amazon (Bodmer et al. 2004a). In Peru, subsistence hunting of peccaries is legally defined as the use of peccary meat for household consumption or the sale of peccary meat in settlements of fewer than 3,000 inhabitants. Rural inhabitants hunt peccaries mainly for their meat, which have an economic value of approximately $23 for a Collared Peccary and $30 for a white-lipped peccary either as subsistence food or through local sale (Bodmer et al. 2004b). Peccary pelts are sold as a by-product and have an economic value to hunters of approximately $5 for a Collared Peccary pelt and $3 for a White-lipped Peccary pelt (Bodmer and Pezo 2001, Fang 2003). Approximately 51,419 Collared Peccary pelts and 20,522 White-lipped Peccary pelts are legally exported with CITES permits every year from Peru under a quota system imposed by the Peruvian government (INRENA 2004). The pelts are tanned in Peru and primarily sold to the European leather industry for the manufacture of high quality gloves and shoes. However, it is unclear if this trade increases the hunting pressure to meet the quotas. Furthermore, how many individuals have to be killed to obtain pelts that meet the quality standards of international trade (assuming that a given number of pelt are rejected because of scars, parasite marks i.e. bot flies, and bullet holes). In addition, considering that peccary glove can sell for as much as $285, a $5 reward for a Collared Peccary pelt does not qualify as a fare trade. On the other hand, increasing the dollar value would certainly further increase the hunting pressure.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

A number of well secured protected areas within the dry zone support Chevrotains. The effects of forest degradation and fragmentation on this Chevrotain are probably not severe, given its ability to survive in home gardens, coconut plantations, etc. (see Habitat and Ecology Section). Sri Lankan Chevrotains are commonly hunted in areas where conservation management was suspended during the civil war, with firearms, for their meat (Santiapillai and Wijeyamotan 2003), but it seems unlikely that this is at sufficient levels to restrain population levels within reasonably-sized blocks of remaining habitat. In the dry zone they remain fairly common in forests even outside protected areas, despite widespread hunting (P. Fernando pers. comm. 2008). Hunting techniques which could be dangerous for Chevrotains include a lot of trap guns in the forest (set usually for pigs) as well as live electric wires, taken off the post, dragged through the forest and set in rice paddies (K.A.I. Nekaris pers. comm. 2008).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0

Recent data suggest that poaching is again on the rise in Russia and Kazakhstan, though there is currently only limited information on its effects on the populations of Capreolus pygargus. It is of particular concern in relation to the isolated population in the Cis-Caucasus. Poaching is also known to be a serious problem in China. The status of the species on the Korean Peninsula is also problematic, as deforestation and poaching might be depleting numbers in many areas of the south and are very likely to be doing so in the north and centre (Won and Smith 1999). Although not presently a threat through much of its Russian range, habitat degradation through grazing by increasing numbers of livestock and human disturbance, associated with resource extraction, could constitute a potential future threat. Severe winter weather and natural predation are liable to have at times a strong impact on the survival or presence of some populations in certain regions (Danilkin 1995, Danilkin et al. 2000), though this is not a major concern for the species overall.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Forest on Manus was still largely intact up until the mid-1990s, compared with smaller adjacent islands which had been converted into coconut plantations (Rannells 1995).

The species appears to be able to tolerate some habitat disturbance and human predation, because the modern capture records came from regrowth forest and gardens, and derive from the efforts of hunters (Timm et al. 2016). Other threats are likely to be predation from feral cats (Felis catus) and the spread of introduced rodents (Timm et al. 2016).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

Ateles paniscus occurs in more than a dozen protected areas in Brazil (160,684 km²; 74%), three in French Guiana (34,768 km²; 16%), four in Suriname (17,144 km²; 8%), and two in Guyana (3,757 km²; 2%). This species’ range includes roughly one million km² (20%) of northeastern Brazilian Amazonia, of which only about 20% is included in officially protected areas.According to a study by Soares-Filho et al. (2006), Atelidae of Brazilian Amazonia may lose 40% or more of their tropical forest habitat outside of protected areas by the year 2050 under one of two scenarios – ‘business as usual’ or ‘governance’. In the case of A. paniscus, three new protected areas (close to 90,000 km²) have been added within the species’ range since 2003, which suggests that its status should be determined based on the ‘governance scenario’; the anticipated loss of suitable forest habitat by the year 2050 would be 40% or more. However, the loss could be greater based on legal threats to existing protected areas such as downgrading or de-gazettement (Biedzicki de Marques and Peres 2014).Habitat loss is compounded by hunting. Based on surveys of mid-sized to large Neotropical forest vertebrate species at more than 100 sites, Peres and Palacios (2007) predict that Amazonian Ateles are likely to experience declines in population density of as much as 75% in areas of light hunting and upwards of 90% in heavily hunted areas. Should hunting in Brazilian Amazonia continue apace with plans for road construction and increase on indigenous lands as government protection policies are relaxed, a corresponding decline in Ateles paniscus populations can be anticipated.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Historically, the Red Fox has not occurred in Tasmania, but if it were to become established in Tasmania this could be expected to have a major impact on the Eastern Bettong, given the evidence that predation by the Red Fox caused the species' extinction from mainland Australia (Short 1998; Johnson 2006). There is evidence of a recent incursion of the Red Fox, possibly as a result of a deliberate introduction (Sarre et al. 2013). This triggered an eradication program (http://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/invasive-species/current-programs/fox-eradication-program). There have been no definite records of foxes in Tasmania since 2011 (http://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/invasive-species/current-programs/fox-eradication-program/fox-evidence-update). Analysis of the pattern of fox records through time suggests the population may now be extinct (Caley et al. 2015). The Red Fox remains a potential threat to the Tasmanian Bettong.Eastern Bettongs are threatened by predation by feral domestic Cats (Fancourt 2014). There is some evidence that the abundance or activity of feral Cats has increased in Tasmania following the decline of the Tasmanian Devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) (Hollings et al. 2013), but the magnitude of this change is still unclear. Recent surveys show that Eastern Bettongs remain abundant in areas where feral cats are present, provided that habitat patches are sufficiently large (R. Gardiner pers. comm. 2015). A very similar species, the Woylie or Brush-tailed Bettong Bettongia penicillata, has recently suffered major declines in south western Western Australia as a result of predation by feral Cats (Marlow et al. 2015). In that case, predation by feral Cats increased following suppression of Red Fox populations by poison baiting, which probably allowed population growth in feral Cats. If the abundance or activity of feral Cats were to increase in a similar way in Tasmania, it is possible that mortality of Eastern Bettongs would increase substantially and populations could decline. It is also possible that feral Cats threaten Eastern Bettongs by transmitting the disease toxoplasmosis, but the evidence from Western Australia suggests that direct predation is likely to be more significant (Marlow et al. 2015).The sensitivity of the Eastern Bettong to fragmentation of its dry forest and woodland habitat also suggests that further loss of habitat extent could lead to localized extinctions. Possibly, threats from fragmentation (and associated loss of habitat quality) and predation could interact, such that exposure of Eastern Bettongs to feral Cats is higher where habitat has been reduced or degraded, and cats also increase in abundance as a result of disturbances associated with habitat fragmentation. This suggests that even quite small changes in habitat or Cat abundance could be amplified to produce significant population declines.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Hedges unpub. data 1991–2002, T. Gray pers. comm. 2013). In Viet Nam and Lao PDR where the rate of lowland forest loss is also accelerating habitat loss is primarily a concern for the future viability of national populations, the species having been hunted out of forests long before they are cleared. In Indochina generally, habitat loss and fragmentation are secondary to hunting, largely acting indirectly by increasing accessibility of remnant Banteng populations to hunting. In mainland South-east Asia hunting is the main direct threat and the species has been lost from much of its former range, even where suitable habitat remains (Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Duckworth et al. 1999, Tordoff et al. 2005, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013). Hunting is exacerbated especially in mainland South-east Asia by human repopulation of lowland forest areas and associated habitat fragmentation, that is, the very areas where most Bantengs occur (Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Although huge tracts of suitable habitat were lost in the twentieth century, and continue to be converted, this has probably occurred largely after Banteng was hunted out (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Thus, the hunting is the proximate cause of decline, but habitat loss is continually reducing the maximum population possible if hunting issues were to be controlled, and is increasing the ease with which remaining animals can be hunted. The recent granting of large-scale economic land concessions for industrial agriculture (particularly rubber plantations) is a significant threat to remaining lowland deciduous forest (and hence Banteng habitat) in northern and eastern Cambodia. Large areas of the species’ current Cambodian range (including inside protected areas) are threatened through land concessions (T. Gray pers. comm. 2013); however 2016 changes in the management of forests and protected areas by the Royal Government of Cambodia may have mitigated this threat to an extent (T. Gray in litt. 2016). The magnitude of the threat posed to Banteng by international trade in trophy horns is difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, given the small size of the remaining Banteng population and the number of trophies found for sale in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam, during what were essentially opportunistic surveys, it is clearly a major threat on the Asian mainland (Srikosamatara et al. 1992; Baird 1993; Srikosamatara and Suteethorn 1994, 1995; Martin and Phipps 1996; Srifa La-Ong et al. 1997; Duckworth et al. 1999; Timmins and Ou 2001). The threat posed by use of traditional medicinal substances derived from wild oxen is even harder to determine in the case of Banteng and essentially remains unknown, although it is thought to be a source of significant threat to Gaur (see 2008 Red List account). A growing regional economy has increased rather than decreased the demand for natural resources, Banteng amongst them, and the potential benefits of hunting Banteng with possibilities of significant market value in the form of wild meat, trophies and traditional medicines must make it a lucrative target.The most important population in Cambodia is scattered through a forest landscape that encompasses four provinces (Mondulkiri, Kratie, Stung Treng and Ratanakiri) and five conservation areas (Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, Siema Protection Forest, Mondulkiri and O’Yadao Protected Forests Timmins and Ou 2001, Tordoff et al. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Hunting is still rife in much of this area, and forest fragmentation is rapidly accelerating with human population in-migration, infrastructural developments (especially roads), commercial agricultural expansion, economic land speculation and mineral extraction (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Banteng remain actively targeted for hunting for meat and trophy antlers in Cambodia serving both domestic and regional, particularly Vietnamese, markets. For example in the first half of 2016 a minimum of six Banteng were known to be poached from Mondulkiri Protected Forest and Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary (WWF in litt. 2016). Banteng meat is also regularly confiscated by enforcement agencies within Mondulkiri province and poaching, both targeted and as by-catch from snares, is a substantial threat to all Cambodian populations. However, although perhaps less than 20% of this area is well protected from the aforementioned threats and protected area management is only close to effective in three areas, the most significant issue concerning the area is the long-term uncertainty of continuation of effective conservation management of Mondulkiri Protected Forest, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary and Siema Protection Forest (T. Gray pers. comm. 2013). Although conservation efforts for Banteng and many other species have been, in all three areas, extremely encouraging for some years as of 2016, they face an uncertain future with the possibility of de-gazettment of conservation status of parts of them, the possible loss of adequate external funding necessary to maintain high standards of management, the possible loss of political support necessary to uphold high protection standards and the uncertainties of maintaining a motivated and well-trained staff. Indeed since 2011 accelerating threats to all three protected areas, largely driven through commercial logging of high-value timber species, is causing widespread ungulate hunting (T. Gray pers. comm. 2013).  In most cases the remaining Banteng populations are well isolated from cattle including the domestic oxen. In Cambodia, the Eastern plains population is still large and thus probably unlikely to be effected by rare introgression events. In Thailand one population of Banteng in Khao Ang Rue Nai Wildlife Sanctuary suffered declines in past years and, as a result, experienced a population genetic bottle-neck (N. Bhampakphan pers. comm. 2013); the loss of genetic diversity potentially increases the susceptibility of deleterious genetic defects and risk of disease in the future. Genetic introgression from non-native Banteng is a threat; Banteng sampled from the western and eastern regions of Thailand identified eight haplotypes using the cytochrome b gene and control region (1079 bp). The highest diversity (six haplotypes) was found in Huai Kha Khaend Wildlife Sanctuary however two haplotypes (seven individuals) from Lam Pao Dam, Kalasin province, were classified as Javan Banteng Bos javanicus javanicus (W. Wajjwalku and W. Klinsawat pers. comm. 2013). In addition to the genetic threat, domestic livestock are a potential source of diseases and parasites. This can have very serious consequences for Banteng which appears to be particularly susceptible to a number of cattle diseases; for example, Banteng populations in Myanmar have in the past been very badly affected by diseases from domestic cattle (Hundley cited in Wharton 1968).In Sabah habitat loss to permanent agriculture is a serious and ongoing threat (P. Gardner pers. comm. 2013). In areas of Sabah where habitat loss is not absolute, the Banteng seeks refuge in dense forest patches generally found at higher elevations because they are unsuitable for harvesting and agriculture (P. Gardner pers. obs). Disturbance from agriculture and logging intervals in commercially managed forest also causes displacement and stress, potentially influencing breeding of Banteng (P. Gardner pers. obs). Hunting is equally significant and the species has been rapidly exterminated from many areas (Payne et al. 1985, Ahmad AH pers. comm. 2008). Rampant hunting in Sabah now targets remnant herds, removing mature breeding individuals important for sustaining herds (P. Gardner pers. obs). On Java some populations are potentially threatened by heavy predation from Dhole Cuon alphinus (Hedges and Tyson 1996, Pudyatmoko 2004). All populations are also threatened by poaching and some, perhaps most, are threatened by habitat loss and degradation (S. Hedges unpub. data 1991–2002). During the 1980s–1990s, when poaching and land conversion were relatively well under control in Javan national parks, the chief threat to the large population of Banteng in Baluran National Park was loss of grazing area to invasion by the introduced tree Acacia nilotica (Leguminosae) that converts open grassland to dense thorny scrub-forest. This plant was introduced (without adequate risk assessment) as part of an attempt to create a living fire-break around the park's grasslands, wild fire then being adjudged the major threat to the park’s monsoon forests. Since that introduction, repeated cutting of the acacia has led to coppicing into very dense thickets that contain little or no grass or other herbs and are difficult for the cattle to penetrate. Thus habitat loss and poaching are now serious limiting factors in Baluran National Park, and habitat loss/degradation remains a severe long-term threat to be addressed (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008). Lantana camara (Verbenaceae) is also a problem in Banteng habitat in Baluran National Park and elsewhere on Java (S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008).Bali cattle have long been interbred with other cattle: Banteng and Bali cattle can interbreed with both common cattle and Mithan Bos frontalis (Fischer 1980, National Research Council 1983). Hybrids between Banteng and common cattle Bos taurus of the zebu type are fully fertile; in hybrids between Banteng and Bos taurus of the European type the males are sterile (Jellinek et al. 1980, National Research Council 1983). Domestic and feral livestock are thus a potential threat to the genetic integrity of wild Banteng populations and a number of reports suggest that wild Banteng does interbreed with domestic cattle. For example, Hoogerwerf (1970) referred to several sources from the 1930s and 1940s which mention that many groups of Banteng in Kalimantan (particularly East Kalimantan) were no longer pure-bred having interbred with stray domestic cattle. Wharton (1957) also found evidence of interbreeding with domestic cattle in Cambodia; and reports from Myanmar mention that Bantengs feed alongside village cattle and occasionally interbreed with them (Tun Yin 1967, Salter 1983). Hunting for Banteng trophy heads continues to threaten the population in Sabah and Kalimantan. Reports suggest an international trade in trophy heads originating from Kalimantan and sold across the Sabah border however first-hand accounts have yet to be substantiated. The majority of trophy heads and horns encountered in 2012 and 2013 were found in wildlife displays by government departments. Encounters of trophy heads are made in rural villages but are generally infrequent because of the fear of reprisal by wildlife authorities but also the demand for horns for use in soups.Introgression with domestic cattle is not believed to be a current threat to Banteng in Sabah but genetic studies are in their infancy. Poor management of domestic cattle has the potential to cause introgression; one old report suggested a feral Bali cow or a Banteng/Bali cow hybrid with (white spotted) pelage was hunted within the south-west of Sabah. A separate report suggested domestic cattle were left in abandoned logging camps in Deramakot Forest Reserve at some point in the past three decades and may have interbred with wild Banteng. In the majority of locations that utilize domestic cattle their security is maintained with fenced enclosures. Water Buffaloes are frequently used in the harvesting of oil palm fruit, and are frequently grazed along forest boundaries. In 2012 in east Sabah, Water Buffaloes were found approximately 200 m from wild Banteng.  The genetic integrity of Banteng is of primary concern in Sabah, where fragmentation and isolation of populations now prevents movement of individuals and the transmission of genes between populations. The removal of mature individuals by illegal hunting will disrupt breeding behaviour and the social structure of the herds, in addition to the direct loss of genetic diversity. Small and isolated populations are susceptible to inbreeding, which will undoubtedly lead to a loss of allelic diversity and increase the risk of identical genotypes. Genetic homogeneity in the Banteng will decrease their overall fitness, and their ability to resist diseases and deleterious genetic mutations. Active genetic management of wild Banteng stock in Sabah is most likely to be the only way to prevent loss of genetic diversity and the imminent threat of extinction.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In recent years, the only near-viable population in Termit Tin Toumma NNR has been subject to disturbance by oil exploration and production and to shooting by their military escorts (Duncan et al. 2014).

According to the Fourth National Survey (State Forestry Administration 2015), the Panda population is composed of as many as 33 subpopulations, 18 of which contain fewer than 10 individuals. The extent to which these are demographically separate populations remains uncertain, but this fragmentation certainly increases vulnerability to extinction through environmental and demographic stochasticity and loss of genetic diversity.Although microsatellite analysis (Lü et al. 2001, Zhang, B. et al. 2007, Shan et al. 2014) and genomics (Li et al. 2010, Zhao et al. 2013) have now determined that the Giant Panda has substantial genetic variability, without increased migration and connectivity, many of these smaller populations will have rapidly eroding evolutionary potential. Three genetic clusters have been recognized: the Qinling Mountains population (Lü et al. 2001, Zhang, B. et al. 2007) which diverged ~0.3 million years ago; the Mishan mountains, which diverged ~2,800 years ago into the Mishan and Qionglai populations (Zhang, B. et al. 2007, Zhao et al. 2013); and the other four combined populations, including Qionglai, Daxiangling, Xiaoziangling, and Liangshan (Zhan et al. 2013). However, in this larger cluster, further sub-structuring is manifest (Zhang, B. et al. 2007, Zhu et al. 2011b). Population divergence is the product of several operating factors, including climate change, natural barriers, and anthropogenic habitat loss.Threats associated with edge effects, human disturbance, and small population size are most severe in these small, isolated populations. Increased fragmentation from roads, hydroelectric dams, mining, and other infrastructure projects further threaten Panda populations (State Forestry Administration 2015), but these trends are partially counterbalanced through the successful implementation of ecocompensation programs that curtail some activities such as fuel wood collection (Viña et al. 2007) and efforts to increase habitat connectivity between some populations (Wang et al. 2014, Wei et al. 2015a). Tourism is increasing in some areas and if not managed properly, could negatively impact Panda populations (Liu et al. 2012). Pathogens and parasites may be an emerging problem compromising Giant Panda health and survival, particularly in areas where dogs, livestock, and other domesticated animals may introduce novel pathogens (Qin et al. 2010; Zhang, L. et al. 2011, 2015). Air- or water-borne environmental contaminants may also exert negative impacts on Panda populations, but little is known about their prevalence. Livestock grazing, inside and outside of protected areas, represents another, potentially growing threat (Hull et al. 2014, Wang et al. 2015). It should also be noted that protected status of nature reserves does not always confer protection, and some threats have continued even after Panda reserves were gazetted (Liu et al. 2001). These continuing human activities may have cumulative effects that further degrade Panda habitat.Pandas' reliance on bamboo as a primary food source puts them at risk during this plant's characteristic mass synchronous flowering and die-off events, which occur at intervals of 15 to 100 years (Schaller et al. 1985, Reid et al. 1989). Before human expansion confined Pandas to high elevations, Pandas had access to more species of bamboo adapted to different elevation zones. When one bamboo species experienced a die-off, Pandas could easily migrate up or down slope to access a different species that was not affected. Confined to its more limited elevation range today, Pandas are sometimes put at risk of starvation, especially when more than one bamboo species flowers at the same time. Although past bamboo die-off events were alarming and caused starvation and mortalities in Pandas, populations recovered (Pan et al. 2014) and these population bottlenecks did not compromise genetic diversity (Zhu et al. 2013).These primary threats associated with habitat fragmentation and degradation may be exacerbated by climate change-mediated effects on Panda habitat in the future. Several models indicate significant losses to Giant Panda habitat, with estimates of loss of bamboo habitat ranging from 37% to 100% by the end of the century (Fan et al. 2012, Songer et al. 2012, Tuanmu et al. 2013, Li, R. et al. 2015). Although these models are simplifying and may not adequately account for distributional shifts of bamboo species adapted to lower elevations and southern latitudes to replace current habitat that might be lost (Wei et al. 2015a), managers should be concerned about large-scale environmental changes facing Panda populations in the future. In addition, climate change may alter the agricultural value of current Giant Panda habitat and bring about intensified human pressure for cultivation. For example, some models indicate that much of Panda habitat will become suitable for viticulture, a high-value crop (Hannah et al. 2013).Although poaching impacted Pandas in the past (Li et al. 2003), its impact declined rapidly since the enactment of the Wildlife Protection Act, which bans poaching and carries severe punishments. However, Pandas may sometimes be caught in snares set for musk deer or other species.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In India, hybridisation is thought to be evident in the North-east where wild buffaloes are known to hybridise with Khunti (cattle camp) buffaloes which were grazed within the park prior to their eviction (Muley 2001). However, it was suggested that there is a genetic differentiation between wild and domestic/feral buffaloes in Kaziranga National Park, and that the Wild Water Buffalo is comparable to Wild Water Buffalo in central India (CCMB 2010). Although, the central Indian buffaloes do live along with hybrid and feral buffaloes, so introgression could have occurred to some degree in both locations. Introgression is likely to take place throughout the range wherever wild and domestic buffalo come into contact. It is estimated that more than 90% of the population exists in the vicinity of considerable populations of Domestic Water Buffalo (See Table 1. in the Supporting Information: B. arnee additional information populations in vicinity of Domestic Water Buffalo). This means there is a the risk of hybridisation is high. As the wild populations shrink  and become fragmented the risk of hybridisation increases exponentially (within a few generations). Given the fragmented nature of the populations and the proximity of Domestic Water Buffalo, and applying the precautionary principle, the truly pure Wild Water Buffalo population could half of the current estimated population, or less.  In evolutionary terms wild and domesticated water buffaloes are closely related, being separated by perhaps as little as 5,000 years (Cockrill 1974, S. Hedges in prep). The phylogeny of buffaloes has not been fully resolved and it is unclear as to the number of domestication events that have occurred in the case of this species. At least two separate domestications, one for ‘swamp’ and one for ‘river’ type buffalo are thought to have taken place (Lau et al. 1998, Kumar et al. 2007, Yindee et al. 2010, Babar et al. 2012) Additionally, the practise in some villages, of allowing wild buffalo to sire calves with domestics (Flamand et al. 2003) may have resulted in continued gene flow between the two, at least in one direction. The situation is analogous to other species which are the progenitors of domesticated forms especially that of the wild cat Felis (Beaumont et al. 2001. This may be particularly the case in Indochina where traditional methods of Domestic Water Buffalo husbandry allowed animals to wander freely for the majority of the year, often in natural habitat over 5 km from villages; indeed, it is often difficult to determine whether animals in forest areas are domesticated or truly feral; as such before hunting largely eliminated the Wild Water Buffalo population there must have been much contact between the two species, and presumably a great deal of opportunity for introgression, albeit perhaps strongly in one direction, given the male-dominated mating system of water buffalo (Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J Timmins in litt. 2013). Domestic Water Buffalo in ‘frontier’ rural areas of Indochina often show a strong similarity to published and other widely available images of Thai and Indian Wild Water Buffaloes (R. J Timmins in litt. 2013), while Clark (undated) wrote that neither local people nor experienced hunters could distinguish Wild and Domestic Water Buffaloes on the basis of physical appearance, on the Lagna (La Ngà) River alluvial plains of southern Vietnam where the two occurred together, and that they were only identifiable on the basis of their behaviour: further evidence that the genepools of Indochinese Domestic Water Buffalo and Wild Water Buffalo are probably very close.  Whilst it is likely that the genetic integrity of Wild Water Buffalo is threatened by introgression from the domestic form, the risk of inbreeding within the dwindling populations of Wild Buffalo must not be underestimated as a threat to its survival. Small populations are at risk of inbreeding depression (i.e. lowered reproductive fitness) which can in turn lead to further population decline (Hendrick and Kalinowski 2000). The small population size of Wild Water Buffalo in central India (34–42 individuals), means that there is a high risk of extinction through demographic factors (WTI 2010). For example, stochastic variation in demographic rates causes small populations to fluctuate randomly in size. Wild Water Buffalo in some populations may face the risk of inbreeding effects through low population numbers. Whilst introgression with domestic forms may paradoxically have the ability to mitigate some of the inbreeding risk by injecting genetic diversity, it carries with it the risk of erosion of the genetic diversity unique to the wild form (as mentioned above).  A challenge to the captive breeding of wild buffalo will be balancing the relative risks of inbreeding and out breeding when choosing candidate animals for a breeding programme. This is likely to require a detailed level of genetic screening, the technical challenges of which must not be underestimated (Randi et al. 2008). Since introgressed buffaloes may outnumber non-introgressed Wild Buffaloes considerably, it may be necessary to view introgressed animals as a vital genetic resource from which wild genetic diversity can be recaptured through controlled backcrossing, as opposed to viewing them as animals tainted by domestic introgression.  Hunting Wild Buffaloes have for long been hunted ritually, owing to their formidable nature and horns. Besides sport hunting that was prolific until the 1960s, hunting for meat is also a popular practice in several parts of North-east India as well as in many South-east Asian countries. With legal protection of Wild Water Buffalo in India, Bhutan, Nepal, and Thailand (Hedges et al. 2008), the severity of hunting may have reduced over the recent past. Although poaching for wild meat is still a real threat to any remaining Wild Water Buffalo populations in South-east Asia, especially Cambodia and Myanmar, trophy hunting may be the most worrying threat, especially if general knowledge of the existence of remnant populations grows, as the economic growth in the region has seen massive growth in exploitation of valuable natural resources, such as wildlife-derived status symbols (R.J. Timmins in litt. 2013).  However, Paradh, traditional community hunting, still persists in some part of central India (Mishra 2000). Also, extensive droughts and habitat fragmentation and degradation have caused Wild Water Buffaloes habitually to invade and raid crops, leading to repercussions by local villagers. This perhaps single-handedly has led to a severe population decline in many states such as in Chhattisgarh.  Disease One of the persistent threats to wildlife is the threat of disease outbreaks from livestock raised in the surrounding villages. For instance, several sub-populations of  another large bovid, the Gaur (Bos gaurus), in peninsular India, were known to have been almost exterminated through a severe outbreak of Rinderpest in 1968 (Krishnan 1972). Similarly, Wild Water Buffaloes are also susceptible to a number of cattle diseases, and therefore, where very small populations remain, they face the risks of extinction due to disease.  Habitat Loss and Degradation:  Wild Buffaloes like most other large herbivores, require large spaces with adequate food and water supply to survive which is negatively impacted by fragmentation and degradation of forest and grassland areas. Although most cattle camps have been removed from within Kaziranga in Assam, extensive livestock grazing in Chhattisgarh may place the Wild Water Buffaloes there in situations of severe resource competition. This is because of pasture depletion and lack of water resources, which could lead to direct conflict.  Local community and insurgency There are areas in central India where Wild Water Buffalo exists and there are difficulties of insurgency and law and order problems. The result is that in such areas, conservation is often difficult to achieve without the support of local people.  Probably one of the most significant constraints, is an under appreciation even amongst conservation organisations of the importance, significance and plight of Wild Water Buffalo populations (Choudhury 2010). This is exemplified by the situation in Cambodia where next-to-no species-specific action has been taken for Wild Water Buffalo, despite the known presence of a remnant population in one area, with to date the fear that the population may have declined and possibly even been lost (R. J. Timmins in litt. 2013).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

The combination of systematic habitat destruction and the commercialization of hunting and trapping likely will ensure the eventual elimination of Bay Duiker outside protected areas (Kingdon and Feer 2013). Even then they are unlikely to survive in smaller protected areas because of habitat degradation and poaching: in Ghana, for example, this species has been extirpated from six parks and protected areas (Kingdon and Feer 2013), and Van Vliet et al.

Habitat loss and degradation, due primarily to deforestation by shifting cultivators and small holder farmers, is the most significant threat at present and is growing rapidly. Forest loss in DRC increased by a factor of 2.5 between 2011 and 2017 (Harris et al. 2017). Forest loss and associated degradation have been particularly intense in the eastern and southern portions of C. hamlyni’s range. The impact is most severe in the submontane and montane portions of the range, where human population densities are highest. Factors promoting habitat loss include rural population growth and expansion of artisanal mining. These will continue to prevail into the foreseeable future. Within the range of C. hamlyni, high rates of forest loss are particularly evident around growing settlements of Beni, Kalima, Kindu, Kisangani, Lubutu, Mambasa, Opienge and Punia. Deforestation and forest degradation are expanding along networks of abandoned roads emanating from these centres, leading to fragmentation of previously intact forest blocks. East of Kisangani, and in the peripheries of Kahuzi-Biega and Maiko national parks, large roadless forest blocks have been invaded by artisanal miners leading to new clearings in remote areas. A recent deforestation hotspot analysis (Harris et al. 2017) indicates that about 40% of C. hamlyni range has been affected by moderate to severe forest loss and degradation. Vast areas of newly-emerging deforestation hot spots intersect with intact primary forests and extend into several protected areas (Harris et al. 2017). For the past two decades, eastern DRC has been the theatre of entrenched conflict promulgated by a multiplicity of rural militia, a number of whom are based in national parks. The militia attack and loot villages, and exploit artisanal mining or are involved in it themselves. The conflict has led to large movements of internally displaced people (IDPs) and has contributed to the opening of new settlements and expansion of existing settlements. In 2017, over 850,00 unsettled IDPs were registered in administrative territories within the geographic range of C. hamlyni (UNOCHA 2018). Expanding settlement and artisanal mining are associated with increased hunting and poaching. Cercopithecus hamlyni is shy and difficult to detect. Although this species is not a frequent target of hunters, its terrestrial habits make it vulnerable to snares set for other species. A recent survey of bushmeat market vendors in Kalima, a mining centre in the southern portion of its range, revealed only one fresh C. hamlyni carcass among 38 primates (dried and fresh) on sale. According to vendors interviewed, as recently as five years ago, they could expect to offer 3–5 fresh C. hamlyni per day. Four hunters in three villages to the south and west of Kalima, bordering the region’s remaining forest areas, stated that snare captures of C. hamlyni have been declining for the past 15 years, and are now uncommon.

The latter continues throughout its remaining range, including many (perhaps most) protected areas. Hunting is mostly practised by local farmers and indigenous peoples in hinterland communities and recreational hunters from larger cities. Both of these groups also sell any surplus meat which usually commands at least twice the price of domestic pork in local markets and speciality restaurants. Efforts to reduce or discourage hunting are also often compromised by generally negative attitudes towards these animals, which can cause severe damage to crops planted within or close to existing forest boundaries, and which are therefore regarded as pests and, hence, a legitimate target for hunting activities. Unfortunately, this species is also threatened by genetic contamination via hybridization with free-ranging domestic and feral animals of ex-S. scrofa origin, and incidences of such hybridizations have been confirmed from Luzon and Mindanao, and reported from Basilan and other islands (Blouch 1995; Oliver 1995, 2001; Oliver et al. 1993).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

It is intensively hunted throughout its range for meat, hides, trophies, and trade, and legal protective measures are often not enforced (Villamor 1991). Some subpopulations or subspecies are now severely threatened. Removal of animals from the wild for commercial purposes and the establishment of deer farms near protected areas (consisting of this species and introduced/foreign species) are a potential threat through the spread of disease and hybridization. Because of its small population size, the Mindoro subspecies (R. m. barandana) is highly threatened, due to the same causes (with intense habitat loss, as over 90% of forest cover has gone on the island); poaching from lowlander Tagalog Mindorenos and hunting pressure from indigenous people might have become the main threat to this subspecies (E.

As the status and trends of Kiang populations are poorly known, it is difficult to come up with one situation that may apply to the entire Kiang population and its range; there is much regional variation in population decline or increase (Schaller 1998, Schaller et al. 2005). There is no doubt that Kiang populations have been decimated in the past, and that they are now absent or scattered in some part of their former range (Schaller 1998). During the last decade, however, successful wildlife protection measures, such as a strict control of illegal hunting, resulted in a population increase in some areas (Schaller et al. 2005). The real conservation issue for Kiangs is related to conflicts with livestock herding practices. Changes in rangeland use policy are increasing the human presence and movements in key wildlife areas, along with increasing livestock numbers (Shah and Qureshi 2002, Fox and Tsering 2005, Schaller et al. 2005, Shah and Qureshi 2007a, Bhatnagar and Singh 2011, Namgail et al. 2011). Rangelands in some localities have been turned into private ranches owned by several families (G.B. Schaller pers. comm), likely causing an intensification of pasture use. Various socioeconomic transformations are also leading to smaller annual ranges of herders, which are grazed more intensively at present (Shah and Qureshi 2002, Shah and Qureshi 2007a, Bhatnagar and Singh 2011). Rangelands are also often fenced from wildlife (Badunah and Harris 2002), which not only prevent Kiang from gaining access to key resources, but may also cause injuries and deaths (Schaller et al. 2005, Bhatnagar et al. 2006, Shah and Qureshi 2007a). It also appears that, while there may be a general perception by local communities that Kiang overuse pastures on a wide scale, the real conflicts occur at a local scale. For example, Bhatnagar et al. (2006) pointed out that in Ladakh Kiang only use 10-11% of the total forage consumed, while the other 89-90% is used by livestock. Still, large concentrations of Kiang may have an important impact on grasslands at a local scale, especially in the moist meadows along river and lake basins, which are preserved by the herders as winter reserve pasture. It should be stressed that in order to address this conflict, solutions must be implemented at local scale – i.e. at the scale of these clearly identified moist meadows.More specific threats in particular parts of its range are listed below:Qinghai (China): The Yeniugou valley is one of the finest and most accessible wildlife areas in Qinghai. This area has a continuing influx of Tibetan and Mongolian nomads who, unlike the nomads in Tibet, lack allocated rangelands (Harris 1993). Gold miners from eastern Qinghai Province first began entering the Yeniugou Valley in the late 1980s and were still using it as a transportation corridor to mining sites in 1997 (Harris et al. 1999). Poaching continues in some places (e.g. near Golmud), sometimes with the acceptance of nomads who perceive the Kiang as a nuisance to their livestock (G.B. Schaller pers. comm.). The Qinghai-Tibetan highway is a major source of disturbance impact animal behaviour (Bao-fa et al. 2007), and has opened the area for exploitation of wildlife.Xinjiang (China): In the Arjin Shan Nature Reserve (AMNR), densities of wildlife in the north and west of Aqik Lake are very low as the area is used extensively by tractors and supply trucks travelling to and from two large gold mines within the nature reserve (Bleisch 1999, Shah and Huibin 2000, Turghan 2013). Pastoralists have settled in the eastern part of the reserve and their domestic horses have been observed feeding with Kiang in its winter range. Such use of the area needs to be analysed and monitored, with special attention to the possibility of disease transmission. Fencing of pastures, hunting and mining are causing a decline in the Kiang population (Shah and Huibin 2000, Turghan 2013).Tibet (Xizang) (China): In the Chang Tang Nature Reserve, most of the area inhabited by pastoralists is located in the southern and western part of the reserve, although human presence is increasing even in the most remote areas (Fox et al. 2004). Today there are between 20,000 to 30,000 people and > 1.5 million head of livestock dependent on the rangelands of the reserve (Miller and Schaller 1997, Fox et al. 2004, Fox and Tsering 2005). Changes in traditional pastoral production systems pose a danger in the Chang Tang Reserve. Remote pastoral areas that used to take months to reach on horseback and by caravan are now accessible in a few days by vehicle from Lhasa (Miller and Schaller 1997, Goldstein and Beall 2002). The complex system of rotational grazing, which has succeeded in maintaining the rangelands, had to be modified due to increasing human population. Nomad groups now use fence to protect their winter pastures and some have built long fences across valleys and hills to keep away wildlife which is affecting Kiang and Chiru (Pantholops hodgsonii) populations, their local movements and migrations (Miller and Schaller 1997, Shah and Huibin 2000, Shah and van Gruisen 2000, Shah and van Gruisen 2001, Schaller et al. 2005). This trend will also intensify land use and problems of overgrazing, and will increase competition for forage. Consequently, there are demands from herders to control Kiang populations (Miller and Schaller 1997, Foggin 2000, Harris 2007). In southern Tibet, there may be less than 2,500 Kiang that could also belong to either E. k.kiang or E. k. polyodon. If this is indeed the case, it will be important to carefully monitor their status and population trends (Neumann-Denzau and Denzau 2003).Ladakh (India): Approximately 215,000 domestic livestock (90% sheep and goats, 10% yaks and horses) compete with an estimated 5,000 wild ungulates in the Changthang region (Shah and Qureshi 2002, Bhatnagar et al. 2006, Shah and Qureshi 2007a). Hence there is an increased pressure on the pastureland. The Jammu and Kashmir Government has encouraged nomads to keep pashmina goats for production of wool by giving incentives that will sustain their living standards. In this context, Kiang are increasingly perceived as serious competitors by some pastoralists and the local administration (Shah and Qureshi 2002, Anonymous 2003). The traditional practices of grazing circuits and resting pastures is getting lost over time, as the system is used for maximizing gains; this is detrimental to the pastures (Shah and Qureshi 2002, Shah and Qureshi 2007a, Bhatnagar and Singh 2011, Namgail et al. 2011). A decreasing tolerance for Kiang may thus lead to a “worsening willingness to preserve it” by local authorities (Shah and Qureshi 2002, Bhatnagar et al. 2006, Shah and Qureshi 2007a).Sikkim (India): The habitat on the Indian side of the Sikkim plateau is the only area that has water when compared to the adjacent Tibetan plateau. The Tibetan pastoralists and livestock inevitably visit the Indian side for watering during the dry season, effectively preventing the Kiang from accessing water sources. The livestock could also potentially transmit diseases. Seventeen Dokpa families (nomads) have ‘Nangs’ (temporary settlements) on the Sikkim plateau (200 km2). Approximately 1,000 yaks and 1,500 sheep are dependent for grazing on the plateau areas from October to April each year, which may cause interspecific competition with Kiang (Shah 1994, 1997, 2002).",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Based on the GIS exercise as part of this assessment (see sections on 'Range description' and 'Population' for details of this GIS exercise), it was predicted that between 2000 and 2010, only around 3-7% of forests in potentially suitable land-cover classes were lost. This indicates that deforestation rates within the Bornean central highlands have been low. Although this may be the case, it is projected that higher-elevation forests will come under increasing pressure from the logging industry because much of the lowland forest has already been logged, and also from the expansion of oil palm plantations to higher elevations facilitated by climatic warming and improved cultivars (Brodie in review). Moreover, the construction of several massive hydro-electric dams in central Borneo will cause the displacement of several thousand indigenous people; this, in turn, is predicted to increase levels of unsustainable and indiscriminate hunting practices such as the use of nets and snares to which many largely ground-dwelling species, plausibly including Hose’s Civet, are highly susceptible. Human displacement caused by hydroelectric dams is also projected to increase shifting agriculture at higher elevations and this, coupled with habitat loss through infrastructure development linked to the dams, logging and oil palm expansion, poses the threat of a fragmented landscape through which habitat specialists such as Hose’s Civet might be less able to disperse than at present, leading to increasingly isolated populations. Based on a combination of such threats, a decline of more than 10% in the Hose’s Civet population is very likely over the next 15 years (approximately three generations).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Jordan pers. comm.). In the last years, the increasing of Palm oil plantations through the species distribution is becoming an relevant threat in the region.Hunting has been reported to have a notable effect in some tapir populations, significantly increasing their chance of becoming extinct in the short term where pressure is high (Castellanos et al. 2008, García et al. 2010, McCann et al. 2011). Where hunting pressure is low it might not drive populations to extinction (Dunn et al. 2011). In recent years, hunting has been reported in Guatemala (García et al. 2010), Honduras (Dunn et al. 2011, McCann et al. 2012) and Nicaragua (Koster 2007, Jordan et al. 2014); and previously in Costa Rica (Castellanos et al. 2008). Sport hunting has been previously reported in Costa Rica (Castellanos et al. 2008).Other threats include disease transmission to wild tapirs coexisting with domestic animals (Cruz et al. 2006); road kill in Yucatán, Mexico (Contreras-Moreno et al. 2013); fire events were documented in Mexico; young tapirs captured to be trade as pets; and a new threat reported in Mexico, disoriented tapirs with abnormal behavior (might be due to diseases) killed or captured in human settlements (G. O’Farrill pers. comm.).There is particular concern that climate change will increase the severity of droughts in Mexico’s Calakmul Reserve and result in a steep decline of tapirs in the Northern Region that could affect the conservation of Baird’s Tapirs throughout their range (O’Farrill et al. 2014).In Belize, continual fragmentation of the Selva Maya are threatening Baird’s tapir populations in northern Central America.  This is particularly the case in the area where the Chalillo Dam is being built and tapirs are being illegally hunted to feed construction workers (S. Matola pers. comm.).

Downer pers. comm.) but today, poppy growing and its eradication, warfare and habitat fragmentation are currently the main threats on this species (E. Constantino pers. comm.). In some areas, hunting is decreasing due to local regulations and people’s increased awareness of this species’ rarity and conservation status. While a few Mountain Tapir populations may benefit because guerrilla presence which may relieve colonization pressure in Colombia by promoting the abandonment of conflict areas (C. Downer pers. comm.), most local biologists feel the presence of the guerrilla is having an overall negative impact on the species’ conservation. Additionally, the “actors” of the armed conflicts in Colombia (army, guerrilla, and paramilitaries) see the presence of field biologists and researchers in the areas that they control as a threat for their safety (Dávalos 2001, Semple 2000). The slow reproduction rate, large home range, and generally solitary nature of Mountain Tapirs make them particularly vulnerable to destruction of habitat and fragmentation by encroaching agriculture (Downer 1997). Habitat fragmentation is caused by conversion of forests and páramos to cattle ranching and agricultural lands. Another major threat to mountain tapirs in Colombia and Peru is the development of new mining projects and illegal mining contaminating water sources.The major threat to mountain tapirs in Colombia is human population growth in the Andean region.  People settling in the region need land, consumables and services, and their activities lead to habitat destruction.  Additional threats include the development of hydroelectric dams, highways crossing protected areas, petroleum exploration, and electrical networks etc. There are numerous reports of tapir being hit by cars so infrastructure development through habitat is a potential major threat. There are numerous proposed highway and other projects in the Andes which would greatly increase vehicular mortalities. Once the construction of these highways is finalized, the vehicles will be able to drive at high speed and the animals crossing the roads will become even more vulnerable. Additionally, these roads will provide easier access to poachers, given the fact that the park lacks enough park rangers to patrol and protect the area. Tapir skin was used in the past for manufacture working tools (backpacks, ropes to ride horses, baskets etc.) and other things such as carpets and covers for beds. Traditional medicine makes use of tapir parts for medicinal purposes being commercialized in local markets.  Also tapir parts are prescribed for medicinal purposes  by shamans. Widespread cattle introduction into the last remaining Mountain Tapir refuges is a serious problem which will likely escalate in the near future. Cattle is a serious risk of transmission of infectious diseases and other etiological agents that they may carry. Disease transmission from cattle has been documented for Mountain, Baird’s and lowland tapirs in other locations. Another problem in Colombia are the fumigations being conducted in National Parks and all zones where cultivation of drugs can be found, including Andean forests in the Central and Oriental Cordilleras. These fumigations are authorized and promoted by the Colombian government, and are a major threat for the mountain tapir populations. The habitat is seriously affected and the animals can possibly be poisoned when in contact with the poison used for the fumigations (Round-Up), which is selective but can affect the availability of food resources.In Peru, there is a lack of protected areas big enough to maintain viable populations. Also the enforcement of environmental policies is weak.Global warming has the potential to decrease the suitable habitat available for mountain tapirs in the near future. If the temperature increases, the climatic conditions suitable for mountain tapir to occur will be shifting to higher altitudes, decreasing the capacity of the current protected areas to conserve mountain tapir habitat.   ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

During WWII caves in the Marianas were bombed (some caves were also sealed off during this time); since then, there has been limited disturbance of roosting sites (limestone caves), resulting from cave visitation and guano mining. Pesticide use is another potential threat. In Fiji, the disturbance to caves and burning of forest near roosts are possible causes of decline. In American Samoa and Samoa the effects of cyclones may have an effect, although the populations here will have experienced such perturbations in the past.

Many areas are also more heavily frequented by humans, their domestic animals and commensals (i.e. red fox, Vulpes vulpes). Vulnerable arid ecosystems are being rapidly converted by infrastructural development and human settlement and activity, especially degraded through livestock grazing (Allan and Warren 1993, Al-Sharhan et al. 2003, Ghadirian et al. 2016). Degradation of desert ecosystems continues to be widely acknowledged as an urgent conservation problem (Bunaian et al. 2001, Abahussain et al. 2002, Al-Sharhat et al. 2003, Mallon and Budd 2011, Sliwa et al. 2013) and could result in a decline of Sand Cat populations, caused by a declining prey base. The Sand Cat's small mammal prey base depends on having adequate vegetation, and may experience large fluctuations due to drought (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Sher Shah and Shobrak 2016 in prep), or declines due to desertification and loss of natural vegetation. In the Arabian Peninsula, sand dune habitat continues to decline (Mallon and Budd 2011). Human induced habitat destruction through underground nuclear tests in the late 1990ies in Pakistan, where Sand Cats were recorded in the 1960ies. Several of the areas have been affected by political strife, and war-like conditions that have accelerated habitat destruction. Habitat destruction through civil war i.e. in Syria. In Iraq, the location which the Sand Cat was recorded from (Mohammad et al. 2013) falls within the Arabian Desert and East Sahero-Arabian Xeric Shrublands (PA1303) which is considered to be “Critical/Endangered” (Republic of Iraq Ministry of Environment 2010, M. K. Mohammad pers. comm. 2016).More recently, additional threats identified are the introduction of feral and domestic dogs and cats, creating direct competition for prey and through predation and disease transmission (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Ostrowski et al. 2003, Sliwa 2013, Sliwa et al. 2013). This applies particularly along roads through suitable habitat (Sliwa et al. 2013, Sliwa, pers. obs. 2015). They are also killed in traps laid out by inhabitants of oases targeting Red Fox, Rüppel’s Fox and Golden Wolf (jackal) Canis anthus or in retaliation for killing their chickens or Houbara and MacQueen's bustard Chlamydotis undulata / Ch. macqueenii (De Smet 1989, Dragesco-Joffé 1993). Locally, Sand Cats may be threatened by the pet trade (Banfield et al. 2014, P. Cunningham pers. comm. 2016). In Iran, Sand Cats are reported to get killed by shepherd dogs and trapped in snares set for other species (Ghadirian et al. 2016). They also get stuck in fences (Sher Shah and Cunningham 2008) and are vulnerable to indiscriminate trapping and poisoning of predators (Mallon and Budd 2011). There are occasional reports of Sand Cats shot in Saudi Arabia (M. Strauss pers. comm. 2008, Cunningham 2009).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

The threats associated with loss in habitat quantity and quality due to the development of timber plantations and afforestation in the midlands and montane grasslands of KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga have been stabilized (no further plantations planned), and are no longer regarded as major dangers to this species. However, afforestation makes the soils on which this species depends less suitable (Armstrong et al. 1998), and has thus effectively reduced area of occupancy. The isolated subpopulations in Mpumalanga may face increasing threats of habitat loss and degradation as a result of mining, agriculture, and human settlements where 77% of the grassland patches are <10 km² in size (Neke and du Plessis 2004). The KwaZulu-Natal subpopulation is very rarely seen in gardens, which suggests it will not adapt to human-modified landscapes. This species faces an additional threat of predation by dogs in urban and some rural areas as well as persecution by farmers and home owners who view this species as a pest, particularly within small scale vegetable gardens. Overall, ongoing habitat loss and fragmentation from agricultural, human settlement and industrial expansion, combined alien vegetation infestation and incorrect fire regimes may be causing a decline into the two subpopulations.Overall, there was a 20.4% loss of natural habitat from 1994 to 2011, with an average loss of 1.2% per annum, due primarily to agriculture (5.2% increase; 4,962 km²), but also plantations, built environments and settlements, mines and dams (Jewitt et al. 2015). There has been no analysis of rate of loss within Mpumalanga Province but the Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency (MTPA) mapped all development applications received at a cadastral scale over a 14-year period (2000-2014), which showed that greatest pressure for land-use change has come from prospecting applications (54% of the land surface area) and mining (25% of land surface area), with the balance of applications related to built infrastructure (9%), residential development (4%) and cultivation (0.7%) (Lötter et al. 2014). Future developments at the above rates or even higher are likely to cause further detriment towards natural ecosystems and processes that this species is associated with. Finally, climate change could directly affect the food resources and impact distribution in the areas bordering semi-arid areas (Hulme et al. 2001, Midgley et al. 2002).However, it should be noted that anthropogenic disturbances do not necessarily cause population declines or a loss of habitat as grazing and the planting of lawns creates suitable habitat and they are found in such landscapes across the distribution. Apparent range contractions in certain (broad) areas of KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga may constitute natural fragmentation as a result of the life-history of the animal being sessile and subterranean, along with its specialised habitat type, and may have become occurred historically before human influence.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

This process started before the arrival of Spaniards and peaked before the first systematic accounts were made (Miller 1980), more details remain to be elucidated. Based on the chronology of human settlement, the historical impact would have been earlier in the northern than in the southern portion of the distribution, and earliest possibly in the northwestern portion, which is the central valley of Chile. The major reduction in numbers and distribution resulted in an increased fragmentation of the population. The resulting subpopulations continue to be affected by a variety of factors, which keep their numbers low or decreasing. It is under these specific local circumstances that myriad biophysical factors can become crucial: human infrastructure, livestock grazing, farming, poaching, predators, new diseases, uncontrolled and/or feral dogs, or unregulated tourism. Huemul subpopulations from such a large variety of habitats and circumstances can be expected to be of different average physical condition, and thus might respond differently to any given factor. One important omnipresent threat is that Chile and Argentina have weak mechanisms to protect Huemul in non-protected areas, and even inside protected areas. The many problematic activities in areas still containing Huemul are mainly related to livestock production, forest products, mining and tourism of all types including fishing and hunting. Another omnipresent and continuous threat is lack of suitable winter range. Whereas some subpopulations have access to a sufficient altitudinal range within a small area (due to steepness of terrain), others would need to migrate over much longer distances, particularly on the eastern slopes of the Andes. In all cases, if the winter range is basically occupied by humans a subpopulation may be hindered from recovering. Most historical winter ranges on the eastern slopes are private and are used intensely for livestock production and/or hunting. This includes many protected areas including the national reserves of national parks. Notable exceptions are the Torres del Paine (Chile) and Perito Moreno (Argentina) National Parks: livestock production was removed and Huemul eventually recolonized low-lands, even into steppe areas (Guineo et al. 2008, Mirabelli 2010). However, in the former, horses and cattle still forage freely in Huemul ranges (Jimenez pers. obs.). Besides loss of winter ranges, migratory behavioral patterns have also been eliminated, as Huemul reaching those winter ranges were regularly killed. The local circumstances of a given subpopulation would determine the need for specific research to address the problems and to find adequate counter measures (Corti et al. 2005).Food competition from other herbivoresCurrently, but certainly in the past, Huemul formed part of a natural multi-herbivore system. As in any such system, it is the combined herbivore pressure on forage that is of interest. Huemul and red deer diets in a lenga forest habitat overlapped between 42 to 62%, depending on the season (Smith-Flueck 2003). Some Huemul populations persist, even after having been in the presence of cattle production for over 110 years (Flueck 2010). The broad dietary breadth of Huemul and the variety of environments occupied historically and concurrently corroborate the co-existence of Huemul with native Pudu, Guanaco, and feral cattle during several hundred years (Flueck 2010).DiseasesIn Argentina, veterinary records indicate the presence of dangerous diseases near Huemul populations, as raising livestock is a major economy for the region. In Chile, screening of 18 Huemul for infectious agents did not detect antibodies for bovine herpesvirus-1 nor Brucella abortus, only two Huemul had antibodies for bovine viral diarrhea even though this population had been exposed to sheep and cattle for at least 80 years (Corti et al. 2013). Flueck and Smith-Flueck (2012c) reported on several disease agents: adult females did not reveal ectoparasites (n=73) and testing for antibodies for foot-and-mouth disease viral antigen was negative (n=41). Fasciola hepatica was encountered in three surveys at prevalence from 9% to 50% (n=108). Taenia ovis krabbei was identified, and Cysticerus tenuicollis was found at a prevalence of 8% (n=12). Ostertagia sp., Bunostomum sp. and Dictyocaulus sp. had a prevalence of 75%, 25% and 13% (n=9), respectively. Several gastrointestinal parasites reported at low prevalence in Huemul are common in livestock and are considered commensals in domestic ruminants.Flueck and Smith-Flueck (2008) reported on bone disease in Huemul from Argentina. Osteopathology was found in 57% of adults, 63% showed mandibular, 100% maxillary and 78% appendicular lesions. These skeletal lesions would affect the capacity for predator avoidance, suggested as an explanation for the population's low average adult age (3.1 years) and lack of recovery. Recently, Selenium (Se) deficiency was found in the first Huemul population examined so far (Cochrane, Chile), with plasma Se deficient in 73% of individuals (Flueck et al. 2014a). The examination of skeletal remains from the same population revealed bone lesions with a pathophysiognomy similar to Argentine cases, but more severe, and importantly, occurring in a population of Se deficient Huemul (details under 'Seasonal movements' in the section Habitat and Ecology). The role Se deficiency plays in limiting Huemul is ambiguous, because there is no single definition for “healthy population” for either wild or domestic animals (Chihuailaf and Corti 2014) and Huemul has survived since the Pleistocene (Marín et al. 2013) in habitats dominated by volcanic soils lacking in Se (reviewed by Chihuailaf et al. 2014).PredationCorti et al. (2010) reported dogs were responsible for 16% of observed mortalities of marked Huemul, based on tracks, scats, hair, state of the carcass and predator sightings (Corti et al. 2013). Other subpopulations though have declined in the absence of dogs, and the nature of local threats has to be determined for each subpopulation. Where predation is severe, including by native predators, small Huemul subpopulations may not be able to recover without management intervention (Wittmer et al. 2014). Recovering Huemul populations affected by predation might require reducing abundant primary prey and simultaneous predator reductions, at least temporarily (Wittmer et al. 2013b). Culpeo Fox were identified as a major source of Huemul fawn morality during one radiocollar study in Southern Argentina (Corti et al. 2010), but not during a fox diet study in the same region (Zapata et al. 2005). Also, Jiménez and Martinez (2010) did not find evidence of Huemul preyed or scavenged at Tamango National Reserve when examining 409 Culpeo scats along one year in a high density breeding Huemul area. More study on the source of fawn mortality is warranted. Genetic problemsCorti et al. (2011) assessed genetic variability using 14 microsatellite loci in one isolated population in Chile. They sampled 56 individuals between 2005 and 2007 and found low genetic variability, whereas the low inbreeding coefficient suggested nearly random mating which would maximize the maintenance of genetic variation. As there is no apt information on Huemul, the precautionary principle indicates that increasing the size of subpopulations by all means should be a major objective.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Although two otter species (L. provocax and L. felina) were subsumed as “otters” and no hunting estimate of each species can be inferred from this data, these numbers show the magnitude of the pelt industry in the 20th Century. Today, the lack of demand in the pelt market and fur trade prohibitions, have diminished the hunting threat considerably. Nonetheless, illegal hunting for fur and trophies still occurs in some areas as Samanco, (Sánchez and Ayala 2006), La Libertad (15°29'S) and Morro Sama (18°00'S) (Apaza et al. 2004), Peru and south of 39°S latitude in Chile.In the last decades, the major threats derive from an intensive urbanization of western South America, where the immense anthropogenic pressure on the coastal ecosystem accelerates habitat degradation and increases its fragmentation (Brownell 1978, Eisenberg and Redford 1989, Sielfield and Castilla 1999, Medina-Vogel et al. 2008, Vianna et al. 2010). It is not yet clear at what point these fragmentation forces will cause isolation to result in local extinction events due to lack of gene flow (Valqui 2012). In any case, these global changes will trigger many specific more local threats in different regions. In and around human settlements, big dens with terrestrial entrances may be occupied by dogs, cats and rats, displacing the Marine Otter from its reproduction, feeding and resting areas (Apaza et al. 2003, Valqui 2012). Dog attacks are increasingly reported in several locations of the distribution (Medina-Vogel et al. 2008, Mangel et al. 2010, Vianna et al. 2010).Industrial and artisan fishing ports have been established along the Pacific coast, affecting structure and productivity of marine life communities. Although Lontra felina shows certain capacity to coexist with humans, for example in fishing ports (Valqui 2004, Ruiz 2009, Medina-Vogel et al. 2007), fishing has intensified global natural declines in the abundance of many forage fishes, leading to reduced reproductive success and reduced abundance of birds and marine mammals (Majluf et al. 2002). The human-otter coexistence implies competition for resources that humans exploit for food, commerce and housing (Moreno et al. 1984; Ostfeld et al. 1989; Moreno 2001; Medina-Vogel et al. 2004, 2007, 2008), as it is the case of mariculture (crabs and molluscs (Apaza et al. 2004). Additionally, marine otters may be persecuted and killed directly for alleged damage to local fish, bivalves, and shrimp populations (Miller et al. 1983, Redford and Eisenberg 1992, Apaza et al. 2004).). Illegal fishing techniques (e.g. dynamite fishing) are a frequent problem in several localities of the Peruvian coast, such as Huarmey (Valqui 2012) and Paracas (Apaza et al. 2004, Valqui 2012). Industrial ships have frequently been observed fishing closer to the coast than allowed by law (Apaza et al. 2004), perturbing the coastal habitat on a broader scale. Another threat for Marine Otters is accidental death by entanglement (bycatch) in fishing nets (Brownell 1978, Mangel and Alfaro-Shigueto 2004, Pizarro 2008) and in crab pots (Medina-Vogel et al. 2004), although the dimension of these mortality cases is unknown.Pollution of the Marine Otter´s habitat comes from several centres of industrial fishing activity like Chimbote (probably the most important fishing port at the Peruvian coast) and mining cities Ite, Ilo and Marcona in Peru, where tailings have been spilled directly into the ocean for over 40 years, altering several kilometres of the littoral (Apaza et al. 2004).Additionally, spills of domestic effluents reach the ocean directly or through rivers (Hinrichsen 1998, Thorne-Miller 1999). Thus, heavy metals and other toxic substances can be diffused through currents and progressively transmitted through the food chain at least in a regional level (Valqui 2004, Apaza et al. 2004). Oil spillage and extreme noise affect the species in areas near beach resorts in the vicinity of big cities (Valqui 2004).A common denominator for all regions is that there is very law enforcement regarding the Marine Otter´s conservation status and protection, as hunting or killings on fish farms do not implicate consequences to the offenders.Global natural factors like the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) also may considerably affect the Marine Otter population (Vianna et al. 2010), due to the more or less drastic climatic and oceanographic changes that cause the mortality of several marine communities from fish to mammals (Apaza and Figari 1999, Wang and Fiedler 2006).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

In the Jura Mountains human related mortalities (traffic accidents, poaching) were responsible for 70 % of the known losses (Breitenmoser-Würsten et al. 2007). There are also concerns in regard of the low genetic diversity and small population sizes shown in some of the populations (Breitenmoser-Würsten and Obexer-Ruff 2003, Kaczensky et al. 2012, Schmidt et al. 2011, Sindicic et al. 2013). The Critically Endangered Balkan Lynx is mainly threatened by poaching, loss of prey base and habitat degradation (Kaczensky et al. 2012).In Asia the major threats are habitat fragmentation and loss mainly due to livestock farming, infrastructure development, resource extraction and logging activities, and poaching, mainly as retaliatory killing due to livestock depredation or for the fur trade (Kretser et al. 2012, Mousavi et al. 2014). In areas where livestock is the primary livelihood source, the conflict is even enhanced. Other threats include accidental mortality through trapping or dogs and human disturbance (Bao 2010). In Russia the Lynx is still important for the skin market and the pelt industry. In Azerbaijan, Mongolia and Pakistan prey base depletion due to poaching is considered a major threat (Clark et al. 2006, Ud Din and Nawaz 2010). In Turkey and Nepal low population size is assumed to be problematic.Poor management structures and insufficient law enforcement and the lack of capacity and funding facilitate poaching and lead to higher habitat fragmentation, aggravating the situation of the Lynx (Shkvyria 2012).",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Other threats include shooting, snaring and poisoning of the animals, as they are considered to be crop pests (Molur et al. 2003).According to government data, during one 42-year period (1956-1993), the country lost 50% of its forest cover and more than 50% if the last 10 years (1994-2003) are included. There is a 1:1 relationship between loss of critical habitat and population number. Therefore, the species is reduced numerically minimally by 50% (Molur et al. 2003). Much of the original forested habitat of M. s. aurifrons in the southwest rainforest areas has been converted to agriculture, home gardens and plantations. These habitats are inimical to macaque survival because the animals are not tolerated by humans (Molur et al. 2003). In addition, 80% of hill country forests were lost to tea plantations during the 19th century. M. s. opisthomelas has been reduced numerically by >80% over 200 years. This trend is continuing as high elevation natural forests are being converted to agriculture (vegetable plots and dairy pasture) (Molur et al. 2003) The Mahaweli Development Scheme has destroyed much dry-zone forest habitat of M. s. sinica (Molur et al. 2003).M. s. aurifrons and M. s. sinica are kept as pets, which is a threat in the dry zone (Nekaris pers. comm.).

Populations declined rapidly as a result of widespread extermination of prairie-dogs and the spread of canine distemper and plague Yersinia pestis (Biggins and Godbey 1995, Biggins et al. 1998). Plague is an exotic disease that did not exist in North America prior to 1900.  It can affect Black-footed Ferret directly via infection and subsequent mortality, and indirectly through mortality of prairie-dogs and resultant dramatic declines in the Ferret's prey base  (e.g., Eads and Biggins 2015). Multiple techniques and approaches are currently being developed and tested to reduce direct and indirect threats caused by plague.Populations of Black-footed Ferrets declined throughout the 20th century to near extinction by the late 1970s (Biggins and Schroeder 1988). A small remnant population (around 100 animals or fewer; Schreiber et al. 1989) was discovered in 1981 near Meeteetse, in northwestern Wyoming, but that population was decimated by canine distemper and plague in 1985 (Forrest et al. 1988).Another major threat is the loss of habitat by conversion of grasslands to agricultural uses; the remaining habitat is now fragmented by great expanses of cropland and human development. In addition, the gene diversity of the current captive population as determined by pedigree analysis is estimated to be about 86% of that which was present in the population's founders (Garelle et al. 2014). This decrease in genetic diversity and concomitant increase in inbreeding may decrease fitness through inbreeding depression, including immune system dysfunction and reduced reproductive success (Bronson et al. 2007).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The latter is largely driven by demand in China and Viet Nam and associated incentives to supply those markets, and involves industrial quantities of live and dead animals and their meat and scales each year (Wu and Ma 2007, Challender and Waterman 2017, Heinrich et al. 2017). In China and Viet Nam, pangolin meat is consumed as a luxury product in high end urban restaurants (as well as more locally e.g., on the fringes of protected areas in Viet Nam), and the scales are used as an ingredient in traditional medicines to purportedly cure skin ailments, improve blood circulation and stimulate milk secretion in lactating women, as well as to treat other illnesses, including cancer (Yu and Hong 2018). Contemporary trade routes are sophisticated and extensive occurring over land and by sea (Sopyan 2009). Heinrich et al. (2017) studied the global pangolin trade and found a mean of 29 new routes each year between 2010 and 2015. Trafficking today follows a heavy international trade historically. According to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), trade data between 1975 and 2018, trade in this species included ~500,000 animals, which mainly comprised skins that were traded to North America, mainly between 1978 and 2000. However, evidence indicates a heavy, unrecorded, illegal trade involving live animals and scales took place simultaneously, potentially involving an additional 500,000-935,000 Sunda Pangolin (Challender et al. 2015). Challender et al. (2019) estimated that trafficking in Asian pangolins between 2001 and 2018 potentially involved >280,000 individuals, most of which involved this species.The pervasive snaring throughout South East Asia (Gray et al. 2017b) means Sunda Pangolins, like all ground-dwelling mammals, are at risk of accidental mortality or injuries in most forests across the region. Local use also comprises a threat, though evidence suggests this is now largely forgone in favour of international trade, given the high monetary value of this species (Newton et al. 2008, MacMillan and Nguyen 2013). Hunting and poaching of the Sunda Pangolin may take place to meet subsistence needs and the ultimate driver is absolute or relative poverty, though in some areas poaching appears to be opportunistic and undertaken by hobbyists as well as organised criminal syndicates (Pantel and Anak 2010). It is compounded by the ease with which the species can be captured once found, ineffective and insufficient enforcement in most range states and a lack of resources dedicated to conservation efforts. It is thought that icreasing demand combined with a decreasing supply of Sunda Pangolins has resulted in poaching in areas that were previously considered too costly and inaccessible for hunting.This species is known to be harvested for international trade in both live animals and scales in Myanmar, as evidenced by seizures in China (Challender and Waterman 2017). Myanmar, on the basis of its geographic position, size and weak government, has emerged as an important transit country for the smuggling of pangolins to China; although the origin of pangolins is often unclear, trade seems to comprise a mixture of pangolins from Myanmar and neighbouring countries (Nijman et al. 2015). The northern Myanmar region has been identified as a potential transit and source place for the illegal trade of pangolins and their scales (Zhang et al. 2017). The population in the southern part of Thailand has crashed because of trade and in the last few years many pangolins have been confiscated from illegal traders (Challender and Waterman 2017). This species is hunted by specially trained dogs, which can smell it out, making hunting much more effective. Habitat loss, often in the form of deliberate and accidental burning of forests, constitutes a secondary threat to the species here. In Cambodia, the threat to the Sunda Pangolin from hunting and poaching is increasing due to rising prices, and loggers are expending more effort hunting pangolins due to a decrease in luxury wood in the forest (A. Olsson pers. comm. 2013). Pangolins are also often hunted using trained detection dogs and certain villages (e.g., those around Botum Sakor National Park, Koh Kong) are known to specialise in training and deploying such dogs (T. Gray in litt. 2017). In protected areas in the Northern Plains complex, local villagers are financially rewarded for simply reporting pangolin signs to local traders and middlemen (A. Suzuki in litt. 2017). In Lao PDR, interviews with villagers in the 1990s suggested populations had declined by up to 90% within a decade (i.e., between the 1980s and 1990s; Duckworth et al. 1999), though there is a lack of hard data supporting this (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006). Consequently, trafficking in the last decade (2009-2019) has originated or been exported from Malaysia and Indonesia, and is destined for China, based on seizure data (Challender and Waterman 2017). Both Lao PDR and Thailand play a key role as transit countries in regional trade involving live animals. Lao PDR is being exploited as a low-risk transport hub for illegal wildlife goods, including pangolins. Lao PDR’s weak laws and ineffective enforcement allow pangolins from both Asian and African countries to be shipped through the country and into consumer countries, such as China and Viet Nam. Between 2010 and 2015, Lao PDR was involved in a total of 43 reported trafficking incidents, in which it was either a seizure (2.3%), origin (32.6%), transit (44.2%) or destination country (23.3%). Thirty-three incidents (76.7%) exclusively involved Asian countries (meaning they did not involve African or non-range countries), and accounted for an estimated ~3,015 pangolins. Based on seizure data from (2010-2015), Asian pangolin species are often smuggled from Indonesia or Malaysia into Lao PDR through Thailand and involve both live and dead or frozen pangolins (Gomez et al. 2016, Challender and Waterman 2017). Eighty-four hunters in Viet Nam were interviewed and every one reported that they now sell all pangolins that they catch (Newton et al. 2008). Prices are so high that local, subsistence use of pangolins, for either meat or their scales, has completely halted in favour of selling to the national or international trade (MacMillan and Nguyen 2013, Nuwer and Bell 2013). The only occasions on which a hunter might eat a pangolin is if it is already dead when they retrieve it from a trap, then they would use the meat and sell the scales (P. Newton, pers. comm.). The price per kg of pangolin, paid to hunters (in Viet Nam at least) escalated rapidly in the decade up to 2007 and since the commercial trafficking in pangolins began to expand in about 1990 (P. Newton pers. comm.). The main threat in Viet Nam remains hunting therefore, including taking pangolins caught as non-target species. This species is in demand in urban centres such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City both for meat – a luxury product –  and scales, and which is attributed to increasing affluence following economic reforms in the late 20th century. Viet Nam is a persistent consumer market in Asia for wildlife species and this is a key factor in the decline of the species in Viet Nam and surrounding regions (Shairp et al. 2016). After two decades of rapid economic growth, newly wealthy consumers are purchasing wildlife to advertise their status, including luxury wild meats the price of which is usually associated with the rarity of a species and its wild origins. Pangolins are often the most expensive meat on the menu in Vietnamese restaurants (Challender et al. 2015, Shairp et al. 2016). Malaysia has been experiencing targeted hunting and poaching almost exclusively for international trade in meat and scales in recent years and though this includes foreigners, it mostly involves Malaysian nationals. Reported price increases have acted to create a strong incentive to poach and enter the species into national and international trafficking (Pantel and Anak 2010, Chong et al. 2016). This is attracting poachers from outside the country (J.L. Chong, unpubl. data). Increasing land conversion for palm oil throughout Malaysia has created easy road access for poachers. The longevity of palm oil cycles (i.e. the removal of old palms and the replanting of new, which occurs on average every 25 years, suggests that where this species does persist in these habitats (Chong et al. 2016), it may not be viable in the long term, though further research on such dynamics is needed. Malaysia also plays a key role as a transit country for the movement of pangolins, mostly live individuals and meat, from Indonesia to China (Challender and Waterman 2017).  Indonesia has been illegally exporting large numbers of live pangolins as well as meat, especially since 2000, some of which comes from east Kalimantan (Sopyan 2009). Targeted hunting and poaching is the biggest threat in Indonesia, especially on Sumatra, Kalimantan and Java, as evidenced by seizures involving several thousands pangolins over the last two decades (Pantel and Chin 2009, Sopyan 2009). In Singapore, roadkill is seemingly the biggest threat to this species and though poaching does occur here, it is not thought to be a significant problem.Secondary threats include habitat loss, largely driven by commercial operations, such as logging, mining and hydro-power dams, and the construction of roads, which has facilitated hunting and poaching by opening previously inaccessible areas. Across Lao PDR, Cambodia and Indonesia this has occurred even within protected areas. The conversion of primary forest to agricultural land is a major driver of habitat loss. This is particularly common in Malaysia and Thailand with habitat replaced with large-scale oil, rubber and paper and pulp plantations. The severity of the threat from habitat loss is not well understood given the species' ability to survive in modified landscapes. However, the ability of the species to persist long-term in habitats such as oil palm and rubber plantations is unknown and commands research attention.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Over-exploitation of Temminck's Pangolin for medicinal use is occurring in South Africa and elsewhere throughout its range, and is increasingly focused on core conservation areas (Cunningham and Zondi 1991, Baiyewu et al. 2018). There has been a sharp increase in the number of individuals that have been seized from illegal trade since 2010 (APWG unpubl. data, Tikki Hywood Foundation unpubl. data). Although the final market for these individuals is unknown, the majority were confiscated in rural areas suggesting local use, although some were confiscated in ports and high-end suburbs suggesting that at least some individuals are likely destined for international markets or for local consumption, potentially by foreigners. This is further supported by large shipments of scales being exported from East Africa to Asia (Xu et al. 2016).A number of seizures of African pangolins or their body parts in Asia (or en route to Asia) provide evidence of an intercontinental trade in African pangolins to Asian markets (Challender and Hywood 2012, Xu et al. 2016, Cheng et al. 2017, Heinrich et al. 2017). The demand for, and price of, pangolin products in Asia appears to be increasing, and traffickers are turning their attention to the African species. As syndicates smuggling pangolins (and rhino horn and ivory) from Africa to Asia become ever more sophisticated and as the Asian pangolin numbers dwindle, so African pangolin species have become more important as source populations for the Asian markets.Across its range Temminck’s Pangolin is increasingly threatened by shifting agriculture, small-holder farming and agro-industry farming. These farming practices are directly impacting pangolins through habitat loss and alteration, while the increased human presence in these previously undisturbed areas is resulting in increased levels of poaching. Nomadic grazing is also having a negative impact on Temminck’s Pangolins across their range as a result of increased levels of poaching. In Zimbabwe, and likely in other parts of this species’ range, artisanal mining is negatively impacting pangolins and other wildlife species. Artisanal mining results in the creation of deep mining pits which are invariably abandoned once the mineral reserves are depleted. These pits are left uncovered and form lethal pitfall traps into which various animals fall and cannot escape. Artisanal mining also affects pangolins through increased rates of poaching and habitat destruction, while a lot of these mining activities (especially in Zimbabwe) occur within the borders of National Parks and other protected areas.Temminck's Pangolins are regularly electrocuted on the lower strands of electrified fences in South Africa in particular (Beck 2008, Pietersen et al. 2014), but also throughout their range where electrified fences are prevalent. The mortality rate for South Africa is estimated at 2–13% of the total population per annum (Pietersen et al. 2016). Fencing is becoming more prevalent across this species’ range, and although not all of these fences are electrified, these fences are likely to become more prevalent and more widespread. Road mortalities are also having a negative impact on the species (Coulson 1989, Pietersen et al. 2014). In South Africa and Namibia accidental bycatch of Temminck’s Pangolins in gin traps that have been set for other species is also a threat, while in Zimbabwe substantial habitat alteration and loss of protected areas due to changes in the land use systems since independence has further impacted populations (L. Hywood, unpubl. data). Elsewhere in Africa local and international trade and habitat loss are the main threats, although reports of accidental electrocutions are increasingly reported from across the species’ range (L. Hywood, E. Connelly and D.W. Pietersen, unpubl. data).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

This is evident from the increase in bats on Codfish Island following the removal of Pacific rats, as well as increases in the Eglinton Valley following the initiation of comprehensive rat and stoat control. Stoats and rats are also known to visit colonial roosts, and are suspected as the reason for the critical status of the Tararua, Oparara, and Northland subpopulations in areas where no logging has occurred. Furthermore, these bats disappeared from the southern Titi Islands when ship rats were introduced.  Populations of this species also appear to be minimally impacted by poisoning through consumption of bait distributed in New Zealand forests to control invasive vertebrate species, and also through secondary poisoning resulting from consumption of invertebrates that have fed on poisoned bait (Lloyd 2005).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Specific threats to particular subspecies are:Ovis orientalis arkalPoaching remains a major threat and is the cause of the latest decline in the ex-Soviet republics. It is carried out by locals, especially around the limited waterholes used by the urial, using both firearms and snares (Fedosenko, 1986; Gorbunov, 1986). In Iran the threats include habitat destruction, poaching and competition from livestock.Ovis orientalis bocharensisThe decrease in numbers is attributed to poaching and competition with domestic livestock, coupled with droughts and severe winters. The Babatagh mountains have been a centre in the civil war in Tajikistan and poaching is totally uncontrolled. The winters of 1968-69 and 1971-72 were especially harsh in Tajikistan, and many urial carcasses were found in spring 1969 in the Kugitangtau.Ovis orientalis cyclocerosIn Turkmenistan, poaching is the main threat, but there is also competition from domestic livestock for forage and water. In Afghanistan, this urial avoids rugged mountainous terrain where it might gain some protection, and instead competes directly with livestock that are seasonally brought into their habitat. Urial populations near major urban centres have declined significantly due to indiscriminate hunting pressure. In Pakistan, overhunting, livestock overgrazing, and habitat degradation caused by fuelwood gathering and by agriculture, are the main threats to this urial. Afghan urial may be more susceptible to such threats than are wild goats inhabiting the same areas because of species-specific differences in habitat preferences (Edge and Olson-Edge, 1987). Throughout its range in Baluchistan, Afghan urial faces severe hunting pressure and competition from domestic sheep and goat, and lives in extremely scattered and small populations (Virk, 1991).Ovis orientalis gmeliniiHabitat loss and competition from domestic livestock, together with poaching.Ovis orientalis vigneiHunting has been relatively strictly controlled recently in India (especially in the Indus valley), but the urial’s habitat is very accessible and susceptible to overuse by livestock herding and other human activities. Urial occupy the low relatively accessible areas along the major valley corridors, all of which have, or soon will have, roads. The resulting effects of increased hunting and eventual human settlement associated with irrigation projects and increased livestock numbers, will require effective conservation and management actions if Ladakh urial is to survive (Foxet al., 1994). Its future status thus remains questionable due to increasing development activities in the major valleys of Ladakh. In Pakistan, most urial habitat is close to human settlements and also not very steep, therefore easily accessible to hunters and for grazing by livestock.Ovis orientalis punjabiensisThe habitat of Punjab urial is declining in area because of agriculture, urbanization, roads and other human developments.  It is declining in quality because of overgrazing by domestic livestock. Lambs are poached at birth to keep as pets. They are a status symbol and although capture is illegal, the Pakistani government is now selling licenses to keep urial as pets. Some are hybridized with mouflon and domestic sheep. Adult rams are poached for their trophy value. Apart from the protected population in the Jabbah valley (700 urial), the Punjab urial suffers heavy hunting pressure and has declined drastically in only a short period in some areas of Pakistan (Chaudhry et al., 1988). It persists only in small populations and at low densities (Roberts, 1985). In addition, competition and transmission of diseases from domestic animals are major threats. Lambs are kept as pets, ram horns are a prized trophy, the meat is eaten.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Over the last century, ca 40-60% of the fertile alluvial floodplains and riparian habitat has been lost as a result of cultivation (for example, winter wheat production, mostly in the past) and livestock farming (ongoing) (Duthie 1989; Duthie et al. 1989, Duthie and Robinson 1990, Coetzee 1994, Ahlmann et al. 2000). Other threats to the species include hunting (hunted for sport and for bushmeat by farm workers), and accidental mortality in traps set for ‘pest’ animals on farmlands. There is also the potential that the dominance of sheep farming and emerging wildlife ranching for economically valuable species may increase the frequency of both overgrazing (and thus reduction in vital vegetation cover) and predation rates (for example, by higher Black-backed Jackal Canis mesomelas densities). Similarly, habitat degradation through fuel-wood collecting and overgrazing may have led to an increase in predation (Ahlmann et al. 2000).There are also several emerging threats that could threaten this species. An initial assessment of climate change indicates that a net reduction of 89% in habitat is likely for the northern population (Hughes et al. 2008). Hence further study is urgently required as to potential effects of projected climate change over the entire distribution.Fracking of the Karoo region is also a major emerging threat to Riverine Rabbit habitat due to ancillary activities associated with fracking, which could lead to increased roadkill mortalities, habitat fragmentation and altered hydrology of Karoo river systems, which in turn impacts on the species’ habitat. Similarly, wind farms are also likely to have a significant impact on the species.Habitat quantity and quality is declining through overgrazing by livestock, resulting in reduced cover from predators and lack of sufficient forage. Reduction in streamflow owing to the construction of dams upstream has presumably also reduced habitat quality (Ahlmann et al. 2000). High livestock, and in some cases, wildlife, stocking rates have resulted in large areas of the Karoo having reduced vegetation cover and becoming dominated by unpalatable species, which have further reduced vegetation biodiversity and stocking  potential for livestock and game. Additionally, continued rural settlement expansion on the Northern Cape Province, estimated to be 9% from 2000 to 2013 (GeoTerraImage 2015), will presumably increase rates of poaching and predation by dogs. However, stewardship schemes for this species in the Karoo have also been initiated and cover 350,000 ha in the Greater Karoo. Anecdotal evidence suggests improved biodiversity and Riverine Rabbit populations on these farms, as well as greater landowner awareness of the requirements to protect Riverine Rabbits (C. Bragg unpubl. data). Continued biodiversity stewardship expansion will help to mitigate habitat loss and deterioration.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Ungulates are the main hunting target. Among them, snaring was found to be greatest for muntjacs and lowest for chevrotains and serow, the target species were assessed by the diameter of the cable (Linkie et al. 2003). Muntjacs are almost invariably hunted with snares and primarily for meat, either for household use or for sale in village markets. Unlike Sambar Cervus unicolor, there seems no significant market for the antlers of this muntjac (which are small) and there is no recorded market for medicinal purposes (D. Martyr pers. comm. 2008). A figure of 51 snares (mostly of size suitable for muntjac) were found in a one km² area and this was regarded by Linkie et al. (2003) as indicating very high snaring pressure. It is, however, well within the snaring densities found within various Viet Namese and Lao forests which retain muntjacs after a decade or more of such pressures, although it is likely that populations are declining and their long-term viability is unclear (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Indeed, J. Holden (pers. comm. 2008), in the unique position of substantial direct field experience in both these areas, stated that “hunting pressure even in the worst affected forests of Kerinci does not come close to that in Indochina”. Caution therefore needs to be drawn in inferring anything about the level of threat, if any, that such snaring poses to this muntjac at the population level. Moreover, without knowing the relative distribution of the two muntjac species in Kerinci it is impossible to speculate meaningfully on the effects of hunting on M. montanus specifically: hunting intensity in montane Sumatra is patchy, and although high on Gunung Kerinci, many other montane areas within Kerinci Seblat National Park are little visited by hunters (J. Holden pers. comm. 2008). Hunters say that they prefer to trap muntjacs at lower altitudes as these animals are generally larger than are those at high altitudes which, hunters advise, rarely if ever yield more than 14 kg of meat (D. Martyr pers. comm. 2008).The montane forests of Sumatra are generally still in relatively good condition although under increasing pressure (D. Martyr pers. comm. 2008).The major threat facing them is, in contrast to much of the rest of the Greater Sundas, not logging but conversion to small-holder and other agriculture, in particular coffee plantations and temperate vegetables. This is accelerating as opportunities for clearance of lowland and lower hill forests decrease because so little is left (e.g. Holden et al. 2003: 39). This forest loss takes place even though most of these forests are under statutory protection for their catchment function or fall within national parks or nature reserves. Pressures are locally very high: almost 40 per cent of one mountain has been cleared in the last 10 years (D. Martyr pers. comm. 2008). Elsewhere, many other montane areas within Kerinci Seblat National Park are at present relatively safe from habitat conversion (J. Holden pers. comm. 2008). Montane forest is also under threat in some areas from mining interests for gold, silver, copper and other mineral resources while pressure for road-building through protected areas continues to threaten core habitats. Conversion of flatter hill and lowland hill forests, legal or otherwise, along the Barisan mountains has fragmented many forest blocks (D. Martyr pers. comm. 2008). The ability to infer anything about threat levels to M. montanus from the ongoing forest degradation and conversion in Sumatra’s highlands is hindered by the lack of understanding of the adaptability of M. montanus to degradation and fragmentation, although it presumably cannot survive outright conversion to non-forest.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

All red colobus species are slow-moving and easily hunted (Struhsaker 2005), as illustrated by a female observed with her infant in northern Congo who remained clearly visible for 15 minutes (Devreese 2015). During this same survey, Devreese (2015) reported evidence of a single hunter claiming to have killed more than 60 red colobus during a single hunting trip. Devreese also identified a substantial commercial trade along the Likouala and Sangha rivers, although this trade may have decreased in recent years due to a perceived threat of contracting Ebola virus disease (Devreese 2015). The immigration of a workforce into logging concessions and access facilitated by logging roads will lead to increasing hunting pressure on wildlife in the northern part of this species' range. In the southern part of the range, Bouvier’s Red Colobus are hunted in and around the Lesio-Louna Reserve (C. Ndzai and P. Malonga unpublished data 2016).

The species was reported to be rare on the island of Manus (Papua New Guinea) in 1985, possibly because of the effects of a mobilivirus outbreak. Animals appeared to be recovering slowly in 1988 (Flannery 1995a; Bonaccorso 1998).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

This fruit bat also faces substantial threat from local illegal culls operated by farmers in response to crop damage (Vincenot et al. 2015b). This problem, which has been largely ignored so far, is particularly destructive in conjunction with typhoons, which result in both direct mortality and further reduction in food availability. This vortex of synergistic threats is particularly alarming, because it remains unacknowledged and unaddressed by researchers and authorities (Vincenot et al. 2017). Predation by cats and dogs is also a major conservation concern. Powerline electrocutions and accidental entanglements have also been reported (Vincenot et al. 2017).In Taiwan, hunting brought P. d. formosus to extinction on the Taiwanese mainland in the 1970s (Lee et al. 2009). It then remained only on Lutao (also called Green Island), where hunting for export coupled with competition with the invasive Pallas’s Squirrel (Callosciurus erythraeus) rapidly drove the local population from 2,000 individuals to a point at which local extinction was assumed. After several unsuccessful searches for remaining individuals in the 1990s, a recent survey however found four individuals left on the island (S.-F. Chen pers. comm). P. d. formosus has recently been reported to subsist in very small numbers on Guishan (also called Steep or Turtle Island). Studies are needed to assess possible threat factors present at this last location.In the Philippines, intensive poaching is occurring on some islands (e.g., Babuyan Claro), where P. dasymallus is favoured as a delicacy amongst locals (Oliveros et al. 2004).

Over the last few decades, the Comoros have undergone a sustained, rapid deforestation, resulting in the loss of nearly all its native forests. Data quality on rates of habitat loss is poor (FAO 2010), but best estimates are that during the past 20 years alone, the country has lost 75% of its remaining forests, the fastest rate of any country in the world (UNDP 2013). This habitat change is caused by cutting of trees for fuelwood and construction, and by conversion of all but the steepest upland areas to agricultural use (for subsistence agriculture and for export crops such as cloves) (Weightman 1987, Sewall et al. 2007, Sewall et al. 2011b, Doulton et al. 2015). With continuing habitat change, this species has retreated to higher elevations (above 450 m asl on Anjouan and above 250 m asl on Mohéli). Even above these elevations, forest habitat on both islands, and especially Anjouan, has undergone extensive and continuing habitat degradation, fragmentation, and loss (Sewall et al. 2007, 2011a; R. Young unpublished), leaving large areas increasingly unsuitable for this species. Human pressures on native forests are expected to continue, as the growth rate of the human population remains high, with an annual increase of 2.5% (UNDP 2013).Roost sites represent critical habitat for Pteropus livingstonii (Granek 2002, Sewall et al. 2007, Sewall et al. 2011b), yet tree felling has destroyed a number of roosts, leading to displacement of bats to less impacted areas, often at higher elevations (Trewhella et al. 2005, Sewall et al. 2011b). Of 23 roosts occupied in 2007 (Sewall et al. 2007), three roosts have been abandoned due to clear felling of forest in the past five years, and only one new but very small roost (15 bats) has been uncovered despite extensive searching effort (Daniel et al. in prep.). This new roost was found in a patch of degraded forest at 1050 m, the first to be found at such a high elevation, and is believed to have been established very recently. On Anjouan, forest clearance, underplanting or significant soil erosion following deforestation upslope of the roost was found within 50 m of all but one of the 16 occupied roosts (Daniel et al. in prep.). Further, the replacement of native forests with agricultural lands on Anjouan and Mohéli may render formerly inaccessible roost sites on Anjouan and Mohéli more accessible, possibly exposing roosts to increased levels of human disturbance. Finally, the loss of native forests has resulted in impermanence or complete drying of nearly all rivers on Anjouan and many on Mohéli (Louette et al. 2004, Fernandez Astudillo 2012). As P. livingstonii roosts are often associated with rivers and other humid environments, a factor which may be related to their thermal sensitivity (Granek 2002), this loss of rivers may additionally affect the quality of roosting habitat.There is no evidence that the species is hunted for food (Trewhella et al. 2005), a key factor affecting other fruit bat species (Mickleburgh et al. 1992). This may be due in part to cultural taboos among the majority of the population that surround consumption of fruit bats. However, the apparent lack of hunting may also be due in part to P. livingstonii’s habit of roosting in inaccessible areas remote from towns; some limited hunting of the other two fruit bat species in the Comoros has been occasionally recorded (Sewall et al. 2003, B.J. Sewall, pers. obs.). It is unclear if the increased access to formerly inaccessible roost areas could expose the bats to any hunting pressure in the future, but any such hunting would likely first affect P. livingstonii’s congener, P. seychellensis comorensis, which sometimes roosts and forages in visible locations in or near towns.The mean surface temperature of the Comoros is thought to have increased about 1° C since 1900 and is expected to increase by 1-3° C more by 2100 due to global climate change (IPCC 2013). It is unclear whether or how such changes will affect P. livingstonii, but since thermal characteristics are important components of roost suitability for this and other Pteropus species (Pierson and Rainey 1992, Granek 2002) predicted temperature increases could affect availability of suitable roosting habitat.P. livingstonii’s small population is found within a restricted range solely on two small, adjacent islands. The species is therefore susceptible to single threatening processes, like cyclones, that could simultaneously or rapidly affect its entire range (Sewall et al. 2007). Further, the species may have naturally taken advantage of elevational differences in tree fruiting phenology to compensate for seasonal variation in fruit availability (Sewall 2002). Thus, the loss of large areas of foraging habitat including all the lower parts of its elevational range, could result in seasonally restricted food availability.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Localised declines occur due to habitat transformation and loss of dense vegetation in some areas. For example, Cape Grysbok ranges have seen local declines in numbers from areas such as the AENP where escalating numbers of elephants have opened up or destroyed thicket habitats (Castley and Lloyd 2013, Tambling et al. 2013). Additionally, some game farms are over stocked and under managed resulting in the opening up of areas of dense vegetation, thus reducing habitat for Cape Grysbok. Even where numbers are not excessive, extra-limital browsers can compete for forage and space (Spear and Chown 2009, Spear et al. 2011).Cape Grysbok are illegally hunted with dogs, which may lead to local subpopulation declines. They are also both accidentally and deliberately caught with snares for bush meat. Localised unsustainable offtakes of trophy males for hunting may lead to population structure disruptions and localised declines.Additionally, the habitat available to this species is declining in area and quality. Agriculture and urbanisation has reduced habitat, but there has not been a severe decrease in habitat quality. For example, Pence (2014) calculated that between 2006 and 2011, 536 km² of land was converted to agriculture in the Western Cape Province (107 km² per year, which equates to 0.08% of the surface area of the province per year). Urban human settlements have expanded by 8.6% and 6.3% between 2000 and 2013 in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces, respectively (GeoTerraImage 2015), which we infer to mean increasing mortality from poaching, snaring and dog hunting. Even though there may not be any empirical evidence for specific impacts of extra-limital species on Cape Grysbok, several publications have highlighted the detrimental impacts of introducing extra-limital and/or exotic species that compete for resources with an endemic species (Castley et al. 2001, Spear and Chown 2009, Spear et al. 2011). Observational data from AENP further indicate that the increase in numbers of larger herbivores is associated with declines in the more cryptic species (for example, Grysbok and Bushpig). Finally, we suspect that habitat loss from agricultural expansion may become likely as climate change makes marginal habitats more suitable for cultivation. For example, climate change is projected to increase the suitability of upslope habitats for viticulture, increasing the footprint of winelands by 14% by 2050 (Hannah et al. 2013).",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Habitat loss is also taking place due to gold mining outside of the Ranomafana on the western boundary, and illegal rum production is a threat in the Fandriana region. These are also large-bodied lemurs, and a favoured prey item among hunters, with hunting taking place by means of slingshots, blowguns and firearms, especially north of Ranomafana, as local taboos operate in the southern parts of the range.Recently, Dunham et al. (2008) performed a demographic study of Propithecus edwardsi, to evaluate the impact of deforestation, hunting, and El Niño on its population. Over 18 years of demographic data, including survival and fecundity rates were used to parameterize a stochastic population model structured with three stage classes (yearlings, juveniles, and adults). Results demonstrate that hunting and deforestation are the most significant threats to the population.Further, fragmentation and forest destruction can force large ranging predators, such as the fossa, to return more often to kill lemurs, and this can cause further decline in population of sifakas (Irwin et al. 2009). Habitat disturbance can also increase parasitism which may impact on lemur health and decrease populations (Wright et al. 2009). Climate change may also affect this species, since there is more infant mortality and less fecundity in ENSO years, and with climate change it is predicted that cyclones and drought will increase in Madagascar (Wright 2006).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Canid-related diseases are a threat not previously identified for Bush Dogs. However, field evidence supports that pathogens may be transmitted by domestic dogs, and the effects can be potentially devastating, mainly due to the species’ group living (Mann et al. 1980, Steinel et al. 2001, Leite Pitman, Nieto et al. 2003, Jorge, Morato et al. 2007, Jorge, Nunes, et al. 2007, DeMatteo 2008, Jorge et al. 2008, E.S. Lima, K.E. DeMatteo, R.S.P. Jorge, M.L.S.P. Jorge, J. Dalponte, H.S. Lima, and S. Klorfine, pers. obs.). E.S. Lima, K.E. DeMatteo, R.S.P. Jorge, M.L.S.P. Jorge, J. Dalponte, H.S. Lima, and S. Klorfine (pers. obs.) observed this effect when a generalized hair loss, suspected to be a type of mange, gradually spread through a group of wild Bush Dogs, eventually killing all individuals. In addition to mange, parvovirus and rabies are diseases reported as negatively effecting wild populations (Mann et al. 1980, DeMatteo 2008).  The species has been identified to be susceptible to both Dioctophyma renale and Amphimerus interruptus (museum collections - Vierira et al. 2008), Lagochilascaris sp. (Volcán and Medrano 1991), and as a host for Echinococcus vogeli (Cestoda: Taeniidae) (Rausch and Bernstein 1972). Captive animals have been identified as susceptible to a variety of diseases and parasites, including parvovirus (Janssen et al. 1982), vaccine-induced canine distemper (McInnes et al. 1992), leishmania (Lima, Fattori et al. 2009), Spirocerca lupi (Rinas et al. 2009), Toxoplasma gondii (Sedlak and Bartova 2006), and Campylobacter (L. Saboia pers. comm.). With the latter, 13 of 15 individuals in a large family group suddenly died from severe haemorrhagic enteritis when they contracted Campylobacter from an infected Coati that they were inadvertently fed (L. Saboia pers. comm.). This loss of multiple animals in a short period emphasizes both the species sensitivity to various diseases and the susceptibility of group living species to pathogens. With increasing proximity to human areas and intrusion into protected areas with hunting dogs, the risk of exposure to disease is potentially high. Exposure to disease may also result from feral or semi-feral, non-vaccinated, domestic dogs that regularly hunt prey independent of humans (K.

A traditional hunting method still in practice in more remote locations involves the use of snares made of heavy palm shafts and bamboo tips set at pig shoulder height, which both serves to secure meat, but in the past also to deter human intruders (Hoogstraal 1951). Dogs are commonly used to corner pigs, which then are shot with low powered rifles or speared with short bamboo shafts with detachable iron tips. ‘Pig bombs’ often consisting of a carved-out sweet potato and filled with explosives, glass, porcelain or metal splinters as well as a trigger, are used both to deter wild pigs from raiding fields, but also to secure meat. Once the pigs chew on the bait, the explosive goes off, causing horrendous injuries to the jaws which almost always, but usually not immediately, are fatal (Lacerna and Widmann 1999, Meijaard et al. 2011).Although most of the hunting serves subsistence purposes, there exists a considerable bushmeat trade in Palawan as well. Formerly meat often was bartered for goods, but increasingly middlemen and collectors buy wildlife products in regular intervals, including meat of wild pigs. Restaurants in rural areas, but also in the provincial capital of Puerto Princesa City, were known to offer meat of wild pigs on their menu. Price for bushmeat in 2006 was double that of that of domestic pigs (Meijaard et al. 2011).Occasionally live wild piglets are traded as well. Palawan Bearded Pigs were reported to be kept as pets within the province, or, similar to domestic pigs, were raised to adult size and then slaughtered.Domestic pigs are often roaming freely in wild pig habitats, and recently Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs were introduced into an area in northern Palawan. Hybridization with domestic pigs is known to be a problem with other Philippine wild pigs (Oliver 1995), but it is not known if this occurred already in Palawan.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Furthermore, where S. hobbit does occur at lower elevation, it appears to be tolerant of disturbance and even of canopy loss, and to make use of garden resources. The only plausible threats to the species are: 1) broad scale loss of forest cover at higher elevations due to climate change (but this might increase the area of upper montane forest over shrubland given sufficient time for conversion); and 2) forest loss due to dieback and fire under El Niño drought conditions. In 1997 there was large scale loss of habitat in the area of the central population due to El Niño conditions and subsequent fires (T.F. Flannery pers. comm.). Lower elevation populations might be either compromised or advantaged by forest disturbance for agriculture. Infrastructure expansion may be reducing habitat for the eastern population (F.J.

Cats are still killed as pests or poultry predators, and these pelts may be seen in local illegal trade. Currently, habitat loss and fragmentation, and retaliatory killing remains as the main threats. Potential negative impacts from current trends in climate change have been proposed (Canepuccia et al. 2008, Pereira et al. 2014)During a health evaluation of Geoffroy´s Cats (Uhart et al. 2012) at two different protected areas in Argentina (Campos del Tuyu Wildlife Reserve and Lihué Calel National Park), antibodies to infectious peritonitis, feline panleukopenia, canine distemper virus, feline callicivirus, toxoplasmosis and dirofilariasis were found in tested animals. Adult parasites recovered from necropsied animals and eggs in fresh faeces revealed the presence of various nematode families, including Ascarididae, Trichuridae, Capillariideae, Rictulariidae, Spiruridae and Ancylostomatidae; cestodes from families Taenidae and Anaplocephaliidae and oocists of Eimeriidae (Beldomenico et al. 2005). These results suggest exposure (recent or past) to common domestic carnivore diseases, and indicate a potential risk to these Geoffroy´s Cats.Human-related mortality accounted for most of Geoffroy’s Cat deaths recorded on cattle ranches near Lihué Calel National Park, with poaching, predation by dogs, and vehicle collision being the main causes of mortality (Pereira et al. 2010).",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

This activity can be a threat to the global rabbit population,  although more information is necessary to document the extent of the  hunting. Also, feral goats may negatively compete with the rabbits by  eating and destroying native vegetation (Gómez-Nísino 2006).Predation  by native and non-native species constitutes a threat to the global  population of the San José Brush Rabbit. In 2011, a Cape Gopher Snake (Pituophis vertebralis) was observed eating a female young rabbit, under a  Palo Verde (Parkinsonia microphylla) (Lorenzo et al. 2014). The  most serious threat is from feral cats which frequent its area of occupancy and commonly prey on rabbits (Espinosa-Gayosso and  Álvarez-Castañeda 2006; Lorenzo et al. 2011; Lorenzo et al.  2014, 2015, 2018a,b). Feral cats in areas occupied by people may also  constitute a predation threat to the rabbits. Predation by cats is  especially critical given the putative tameness of this insular species.  It has also been felt that the Ringtail (Bassariscus astutus) may prey  on rabbits, but Ringtails mainly live in the rocky hills and not in the  area of rabbit occupancy on the island, thus they may be only occasional  and opportunistic predators (Lorenzo et al.  2011). Several other species on San José Island could prey on rabbits:  rattlesnakes (Crotalus enyo enyo, C. mitchelli mitchelli, C. ruber  lucanensis), gopher snakes (Pituophis melanoleucus bimaris, P.  vertebralis), Osprey (Pandion haliaetus), Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo  jamaicensis), Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus), and American Kestrel  (F. sparverius) (Cody and Velarde 2002, Espinosa-Gayosso and  Álvarez-Castañeda 2006, Lorenzo et al. 2018b).The most  important threat to the San José Brush Rabbit is related to human  development activities, in spite of their protected status on San José  Island under Mexican law (SEMARNAT 2010). Plans for a resort are being  developed with an accompanying golf course, private airport and small  marina in prime habitat occupied by the rabbit. This development would  cause a loss of habitat (area of occupancy) of the rabbit, including  breeding and reproduction sites. Additionally, a salt mine close to the  area of highest rabbit density may be activated in the near future, and  this facility could be used for worker housing and equipment storage.  Free-ranging dogs and cats of the workers would then contribute to  further predation on the rabbit (Lorenzo et al. 2011, Lorenzo et al. 2018b).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The distribution of S. pribilofensis is naturally restricted to a single island, so this species is vulnerable to localized perturbations. Habitat is largely intact, but human activities and climatic warming are of potential concern (ADFG 2005). Although the effects of climate change on this species' habitat are unknown, these shrews are a relict, cold-adapted species that could be compromised by a warmer climate.  Byrd and Norvell (1993) found the shrews to be distributed widely at relatively high densities, and they identified no immediate threats to the species or to most habitat areas. Little habitat fragmentation has occurred. Of Saint Paul Island's 10,093 hectares, only 2-3% has been developed. This includes the village of Saint Paul, a fish processing plant, the Coast Guard Loran station, an airport, the POSS Helicopter camp (Pribilof Offshore Support Service), and a new seaport. There are approximately 35 miles of roads which section the island into several large parcels. These facilities do not appear to have caused significant fragmentation of the shrew habitat to date (Byrd and Norvell 1988). Potential threats include habitat loss to development and overgrazing by reindeer, and population declines if rats are incidentally introduced to the island.At present, development activities are primarily directed toward the construction of a major harbour and port facility in Village Cove. Anticipated development includes: expansion of industrial processing facilities both within and near the harbour area; new commercial ventures including a chandlery; expanded support services; increased uses and trespass on traditional subsistence and recreation land; and expansion of air transport facilities and services. Additional future developments may also include expansion of the OCS support services for oil and gas extraction activities. Current land use plans indicate that these developments will occur primarily in the immediate vicinity of the village and harbour and along a development corridor between the village and the airport. Much of this area has been identified as preferred shrew habitat and contains high shrew densities (Byrd and Norvell 1988). Proportionally, this region involves approximately 12% of the total preferred shrew habitat on the island (estimated from Byrd and Norvell 1988, Fig 2).With recent completion of the new seaport, increased shipping traffic is expected and the potential for Norway rat introductions will increase. The ecological consequences of this possibility are not well known. Rats introduced to different Aleutian Islands have spread across entire islands, invading most habitats. They are believed to function as significant predators of birds and other wildlife on these islands. Byrd and Norvell (1988) predicted that predation on the shrews would increase if rats were introduced to Saint Paul Island. It is also possible that they could introduce disease that is detrimental to the shrews, though this possibility has not been documented.Reindeer were introduced on the island in 1911 (Fay and Sease 1985). Here they prospered, their numbers reaching a peak abundance of over 2,000 animals in 1938, which was followed shortly by a ""crash"" to only a few animals. This over-extension of their carrying capacity greatly impacted the vegetation and shrew habitat (Fay and Sease 1985). The herd is now maintained at approximately 500 animals.Arctic fox and localized house cat predation do not appear to pose serious threats to the long-term viability of the population.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Over 78% of the habitat within the species' range is either naturally unavailable, severely degraded, or is in a land-use category that represents a threat to the ground squirrel; the remainder is under threat from continued development and habitat fragmentation (Stewart 2005). The planned Fort Irwin expansion would fragment one of four remaining populations that appear to be stable, posing a serious threat to the species' persistence (Stewart 2005). Current regulatory mechanisms are believed to be inadequate to protect this species (Stewart 2005). This species may be expanding its range at the expense of the Mohave ground squirrel (Wessman, in Hafner 1992).This species fails to reproduce during years of drought rather than risking a delay in accumulating fat reserves for aestivation. Periods of prolonged drought therefore is a potential threat to the population. The taxon exists as isolated populations with a scattered distribution.

In addition to removing required vegetative cover and forage, tilling and other soil disturbance destroys the necessary structure of the specific silty soil types (i.e., Warden soils) on which the species relies (Greene 1999). Intensive grazing removes vegetative cover and forage, degrading the habitat for ground squirrels (Greene 1999). Betts (1990) rated 21 of 80 colonies as highly vulnerable to extinction due to colony size, isolation from other colonies, land ownership, and threat from human activity.However, the majority of existing colonies are located on the Boardman Bombing Range and the Boeing tract, which include the largest contiguous tract of suitable habitat (USFWS 2004). Although future Boardman Bombing Range activities are not certain, they are not expected to change significantly in the foreseeable future (USFWS 2004). In 2003, the largest threat to colonies in Oregon was the imminent conversion of the Boeing tract for agriculture. However, under a newly signed agreement, Threemile Canyon Farms placed 9,146 ha (22,600 acres) of the Boeing tract into a permanent ODFW Conservation Easement (Boardman Conservation Area), which is managed by TNC with the goal to maintain and improve where feasible the integrity of existing native communities and associated covered species (including the Washington ground squirrel) (USFWS 2004). All but two known sites and the majority of suitable habitat on the Boeing tract are located on the Boardman Conservation Area and therefore are protected from irreversible habitat modification (USFWS 2004). Hence threats from habitat loss have been significantly reduced in recent years. USFWS (2004) reasoned that this has reduced the immediacy of threats to the Washington ground squirrel, but actually it is the scope of threat that has been reduced; ground squirrel colonies that are not on conservation lands remain vulnerable to continued habitat loss (USFWS 2004).Quade (1994) concluded that invasion of non-indigenous and noxious weeds also has contributed to the degradation of the habitat.Ground squirrels are often viewed as pests and are subject to recreational shooting and poisoning to reduce impacts to agricultural crops (USFWS 2004). Olterman and Verts (1972) attributed the decline of Washington ground squirrels from 1948 to 1970 to years of control by poisoning and/or shooting, in addition to significant habitat loss.Predation by badgers can be a significant mortality factor. Badger predation may cause local extirpations of small, isolated colonies (Betts 1999).Sylvatic plague, which was responsible for large population declines of Spermophilus townsendii (a closely related species) several decades ago, is a potential threat (USFWS 2004).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Central and Lake District populations are suffering from extensive and intensive habitat loss and fragmentation by habitat conversion to pine plantations and logging of the remnant temperate Valdivian rainforest (Willson et al. 2005, Echeverría et al. 2006, 2008). On Chiloé Island, native forests have been largely cleared and fragmented over large areas to support domestic fowl, grazing and farming, leaving only remnants of the original forest surrounded by a human-modified matrix (Armesto et al. 1998, Sanderson et al. 2002). In its southernmost range, human density is lower, there is a greater amount of forest cover and agricultural lands are more frequently surrounded by a concentration of protected areas. An annual forest loss rate of 4.5% per year was estimated for the period 1975-2000 in Chilean temperate rainforests (equivalent to 67% reduction of total forest area) (Echeverría et al. 2006). These trends have not ceased and will continue into the future. Future trends predict similar forest loss rates for the period 2010-2020 (Echeverría et al. 2008). Due to its restricted distribution and ecological requirements, the Guiña is especially vulnerable to increasing trends of habitat loss and fragmentation.Evidence suggests that increased landscape fragmentation is associated with reduced genetic diversity in Guiñas (Napolitano et al. submitted). Small population size would be the major force driving the decrease in genetic diversity of Guiñas inhabiting fragmented landscapes (e.g., low carrying capacity, local extinctions, road kills). This scenario is also supported by a pattern of Ne >> N found in various subpopulations throughout Guiña distribution range, showing they may be going through a current size reduction (i.e., genetic bottleneck) (Napolitano et al. 2014).On the other hand, most people in rural landscapes of central and southern Chile have negative attitudes towards Guiñas, arguing livestock and poultry losses (Herrmann et al. 2013, Zorondo-Rodríguez et al. 2014). 81.4% of 43 families interviewed in a rural area of southern Chile considered Guiñas “damaging"" or ""very damaging”, although there was only a single recent report of a Guiña killing 12 hens in a henhouse (Silva-Rodríguez et al. 2007). Illegal killing as retaliation for poultry depredation is the most likely outcome when a Guiña is caught within a chicken coup. On Chiloe Island, two out of seven radio-collared Guiñas were killed while raiding chicken coops (Sanderson et al. 2002). Retaliatory killings for poultry depredation accounted for 39.4% of the total 38 Guiña samples collected during a three-year study in Chiloé Island (Napolitano 2012, Napolitano et al. submitted).Guiñas also get killed by dogs and cars. Road kills are a major death cause, specially in fragmented landscapes, where they accounted for 29% of the total 38 Guiña samples collected during a three-year study in Chiloé Island (Napolitano 2012, Napolitano et al. submitted).Other threats include diseases and climate change; Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) and Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) infection was recorded in Guiñas and sympatric domestic cats in human perturbed landscapes on Chiloé Island, suggesting a possible interspecies transmission facilitated by increased contact probability through human invasion into natural habitats, habitat fragmentation and poultry attacks (Mora et al. in press). On the other hand, climate change is also an important potential threat for Guiñas.

Hunting is regulated by  individual state wildlife agencies (Chapman and Ceballos 1990). While  hunting is not a major threat to stable populations (Nielsen and Berkman  2018), Swamp Rabbits appear to have a sensitivity to harvest in the  late season (winter) (Bond et al. 2004). Population viability  modeling suggests that changes in fecundity and catastrophic flooding  may pose the greatest risk to the species (Robinson et al. 2016).Habitat  loss has been the greatest cause of decline of Swamp Rabbits. In  Missouri in 1973, a decline of suitable habitat from 850,000 ha to  40,000 ha was recorded over the previous 103 years (Korte and  Fredrickson 1977). The habitat was converted from forest to cropland.  Changes to waterways and resulting flooding also negatively impact the  availability of habitat for Swamp Rabbits (Nielsen and Berkman 2018).Habitat  fragmentation is an issue associated with human encroachment upon Swamp  Rabbit habitat. Many Swamp Rabbit populations exist on small tracts of  private property, impeding dispersal and creating difficulties for  management (Scheibe and Henson 2003).Flooding of wet forested  areas has a negative impact on Swamp Rabbit populations, but floods in  some areas induce dispersal (Scheibe and Henson 2003).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Hunting pressure is thought to be more severe in areas of high-density human settlements. For example, in the southern part of Jameson’s Red Rock Hare’s eastern range, intensive urbanization (Johannesburg, Pretoria, and surrounds) is likely to be impacting on local subpopulations (Matthee et al. 2016). Some decrease in habitat quality has occurred due to commercial plantations of pine and eucalyptus within this rock hare’s habitat (Matthee, Collins and Keith 2004). The replacement of natural vegetation by forestry plantations in Mpumalanga and Limpopo provinces will presumably reduce habitat quality for Jameson’s Red Rock Hare (sensu Armstrong and van Hensbergen 1996).

Habitat loss due to building houses on rocky outcrops also  occurs, but this is not currently considered a serious threat (Matthee et al.  2004). Additionally, agricultural and rural settlement expansion may be  increasing incidental predation on rock hares by domestic dogs. Sheep  farming is also impacting Smith’s Red Rock Hare. In areas where there is  intensive sheep farming, the species may face grazing competition (B.  Wilson pers. obs.). Additionally, as a consequence of available food  resources, many sheep-farming areas also report higher than normal rates  of predators such as Black-backed Jackals (Canis mesomelas) and  Caracals (Caracal caracal), which is exacerbated by indiscriminate and  non-holistic predator control methods (Minnie et al. 2016). These  predators pose a threat to the rock hares when at abnormally high  numbers. There has been a greater than 20% loss of habitat since the  1900's and future loss is predicted to continue at the same rate until  the year 2022 (Matthee et al. 2004).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Accidental drowning in nets and traps set for fish and crustaceans has the potential to impact Platypus distribution and abundance in all parts of its range, especially in small streams where populations may be critically small.

DFTD has been associated with local population declines of up to 89% since first reported (Hawkins et al. 2006, McCallum et al. 2007), indicated by long-term spotlighting data, widespread trapping and laboratory results. The declines, and the prevalence of the disease, have not eased off in any monitoring sites, and DFTD is present even in very low density areas. It is estimated that the adult population is approximately halving annually on the Freycinet peninsula (Lachish et al. 2007) with extinction predicted at this site 10-15 years after disease arrival (McCallum et al. 2007). Declines were most marked in areas where the disease had been reported earliest, in north-eastern and central eastern Tasmania.Mean spotlighting sightings of Tasmanian Devils per 10 km route, obtained from across the core Tasmanian Devil range (eastern and north-western Tasmania), have declined by 53% since the first report of DFTD-like symptoms in 1996 (McCallum et al. 2007). The most immediately threatened location is thought to be the region where DFTD was reported prior to 2003: across 15,000 km² of eastern Tasmania. By 2005, the Devil Disease Project Team had confirmed DFTD in individuals found across 36,000 km² of eastern and central Tasmania (Hawkins et al. 2006). DFTD is now confirmed across more than 60% of the devil's overall distribution (C. Hawkins unpubl.), and there is evidence for continued geographical spread of the disease (Hawkins et al. 2006), so that Tasmanian Devils across between 51% and 100% of Tasmania may be, or have already been, subject to >90% declines in a ten-year period. The currently affected region covers the majority of the formerly high-density eastern management unit, involving what was perhaps around 80% of the total population.DTFD has resulted in the progressive loss of first the older adults from the population and then the younger adults (Lachish et al. 2007) so that populations are comprised of one and two year olds (Jones et al. in press, Lachish et al. submitted). As female devils usually breed for the first time at age two, they may not successfully raise a litter before they die of DFTD (Lachish et al. submitted). An increase in precocial breeding indicates some compensatory response, but as yet this appears to have been insufficient to counter mortality (Jones et al. in press, Lachish et al. submitted).DFTD behaves like a frequency-dependent disease, probably because the majority of the injurious biting, which is the type of contact most likely to lead to disease transmission, occurs between adults during the mating season (Hamede et al. in press). Frequency-dependent diseases, which are typically sexually transmitted, can lead to extinction (McCallum and Jones 2006). Because transmission occurs between the sexes at mating irrespective of population density, these types of diseases lack a threshold density below which they become extinct.Cannibalism is considered fairly common in Tasmanian Devils and renders the species particularly vulnerable to disease transmission (Pfennig et al. 1998; Jones et al. 2007). However, modes of transmission of DFTD are not as yet known.Road-killsA recent three-year study of roadkill frequency on the main roads of Tasmania estimated 2,205 Tasmanian Devils are killed on roads annually (Hobday and Minstrell submitted). This suggests that 2-3.% of the total Tasmanian Devil population are killed on roads (based on an estimated population of 60,000–90,000 individuals at the time of the survey). The roaded parts of Tasmania closely match the core distribution area for Tasmanian Devils.Roadkill was attributed as the cause of up to 50% and 20% of Tasmanian Devil death during a recording period of 17 months at Cradle Mountain and 12 months at Freycinet National Parks, respectively (Jones 2000; M. Jones pers. comm.). Local extinction and a similar rate of population decline at Cradle Mountain indicates that roadkill can cause local extinction, in which the road becomes a local sink (Jones 2000). Future impact is likely to remain at the same level.Dog killsReports of about 50 devils killed per year by poorly controlled dogs are served from about 20 dog owners. There is no obligation or incentive for such reports, and generally some hesitance even among those providing them, so the real figures are more likely of the order of several hundred devils killed by dogs each year.FoxesThere have been spasmodic, small-scale introductions of the Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) into Tasmania since early European colonisation. Early incursions were sometimes efforts at acclimatisation and others for short-term hunting. More recently, there has been at least one accidental incursion (from a container ship in 1998) and credible reports of a concerted, malicious campaign of introduction. Hard evidence (confirmed scats, carcasses) of foxes has been found in the north-west and northern and southern midlands. Credible sighting reports have come from most of the eastern half of the State including the central highlands and the far north-west (Fox Free Tasmania 2006), mostly areas where Tasmanian Devil populations are suppressed by DFTD.A commonly held view has been that the abundance of Tasmanian Devils has prevented fox establishment through interference competition, either aggressive exclusion or predation on denned juveniles (Jones et al. 2007). Red Foxes and Tasmanian Devils share preferences for den sites and habitat, and are of a similar size. Tasmanian Devils abundance is likely to slow, if not prevent, fox establishment. It is possible that foxes have been present in Tasmania for many decades at sub-detectable levels, and that a degree of ecological release has occurred due to DFTD, with foxes increasing to detectable numbers. The current impact of the Red Fox has been quantified (N. Mooney pers. comm.), and it is unlikely that fox numbers are currently at a level to impose a measurable impact.A decline in Tasmanian Devils number may create a short to medium-term surplus of food, for example carrion; ideal for fox establishment. Fox establishment may cause both direct and indirect effects on Tasmanian Devils. Direct effects include (reciprocal) killing by then abundant foxes of then rare juvenile devils at dens while the female forages (Jones et al. 2007). Fox establishment may also cause ecosystem disruptions through changes in other species (Jones et al. 2007) - a feature of foxes on mainland Australia (e.g. Saunders et al. 1995) and something that might then also indirectly affect Tasmanian Devils. Tasmania has the potential to hold up to 250,000 foxes (based on modelling of habitat preferences and densities in south-east mainland Australian) which could replace most medium- to large-sized marsupial carnivores (N. Mooney unpubl.).PersecutionIn the past, persecution of the Tasmanian Devil has been very high throughout settled parts of Tasmania, and is thought to have brought about very low numbers at times. Through the 1980s and 1990s, systematic poisoning in many sheep-growing areas (particularly fine-wool with its reliance on merinos) was widespread and probably killed in excess of 5000 devils per year (N. Mooney unpubl., from interviews with landowners). In the 1990s, control permits were occasionally issued to individuals who were able to argue that Tasmanian Devils were pests (e.g. killing valuable lambs).Current persecution is much reduced, but can still be locally intense with in excess of 500 devils thought to be killed per year (N. Mooney pers. comm.). However, this is reducing since devil numbers have declined. While the small amount of current persecution is likely to persist it is unlikely to constitute a major threat unless the Tasmanian Devil population becomes extremely small and fragmented.Low genetic diversityJones et al. (2004) found the genetic diversity of Tasmanian Devils to be low relative to many Australian marsupials as well as placental carnivores. This was consistent with an island founder effect, but previous marked reductions in population size may also have played a role. Low genetic diversity can reduce population viability (Eldridge et al. 1999) and resistance to disease (Acevedo-Whitehouse et al. 2005).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

While the species as a whole is Least Concern, large tracts of its extent of occurrence (EOO)—namely across the Great Basin – have seen local population extirpations, range contractions (upslope movement of the lower-elevation range boundary), and reduced densities (Beever et al. 2003, 2010, 2011; Wilkening et al. 2011). Three alternative classes of direct thermal stresses may affect the persistence of pika populations (Beever et al. 2010): 1) acute cold stress (number of days below a very cold threshold temperature); 2) acute heat stress (number of days above a warm threshold temperature; and 3) chronic heat stress (such as average summer temperature). Acute cold stress may arise from reduced snowpack (observed across western North America; Mote et al. 2005) which in turn may result from more precipitation falling as rain and less as snow, or warmer days leading to a more rapid melt-off of snowpack, or both. Without the snowpack that acts as an insulator during winter, pikas might freeze or extinguish their food supplies while attempting to thermoregulate leading to an increase in mortality (Smith 1978, Beever et al. 2010). While some areas have extant populations at higher elevations to and from which pikas could disperse, the insular nature of talus habitat means that many populations that become extirpated will remain so on an ecological time scale – the likelihood of recolonization is extremely remote. While extinctions in the Great Basin have been going on for a long time (~7,500 years), the recent rate is high and indicative of observed increases in temperature in the region due to climate change (Beever et al. 2011). Current American Pika distributions in the Great Basin represent a perfect storm generated by the high temperatures (in summer) and reduced snowpack (in winter; Mote et al. 2005) caused by climate change.A counterbalance to the data accumulated in the Great Basin is the population of pikas at Bodie, California, at about 2,550 m elevation just 35 km west of the Sierra Nevada crest where summer temperatures are relatively warm. There pikas occupy insular patches of habitat (ore dumps left by mining activity) that are spaced across a landscape of Great Basin shrub vegetation. This classic metapopulation, the longest-term study of any pika species, has been observed since the late 1940s (Severaid 1955) and semi-continuously since 1969 (Smith 1974 a, b, 1978, 1980; Smith and Gilpin 1997), including annual censuses (with a couple of two-year gaps) from 1989 to 2010 (Smith unpublished data). Approximately 78 ore dump patches have been included in each census. In 1991 the southern half of the figure-eight-shaped study area experienced a meta-population collapse and has not recovered (Smith and Gilpin 1987); in 2010 the southern constellation of patches was still void of pikas. However, the 37 patches in the northern constellation showed a slightly higher occupancy rate in 2009 (84%; the lowest percent occupancy was 49% in the north) than in the first full census in 1972. Thus, there appears to be no evidence that heat stress in summer at Bodie causes mortality or population decline of pikas on these small habitat islands, although warm temperatures may have inhibited colonization of the southern constellation.Another largely Great Basin threat is competition with free-ranging and feral cattle in those situations where livestock are allowed to graze within the typical pika foraging distance from the talus margin (Beever et al. 2003). Most pikas live in cattle-free areas or, in Colorado, grazing temporally occurs primarily in fall after pikas have completed their haypiles. But in the Great Basin cattle graze adjoining many of the limited pika populations. Beever et al. (2003) noted that cattle grazing could be contributory to some pika population extirpations. Pika density was lower in areas that were heavily grazed—primarily small sites with more edge compounding the effect of grazing (Beever unpublished data). Further, presence of livestock grazing increased in importance from the 20th century observations to the 1999-2008 observation period in terms of predicting the pattern of site-level persistence of pikas in the Great Basin (Beever et al. 2011). Millar (in press) has compared placement of pika haypiles in Great Basin ranges at sites with and without cattle grazing. Normally, pikas place their haypiles close to the talus/vegetation interface; at her cattle-free sites this distance averaged 1.8 m from the talus edge. At grazed sites pikas placed their haypiles an average of 30 m upslope from the talus edge and were forced to forage on comparatively poor vegetation growing amidst the rocks. Millar concluded that grazing effects could be contributing to observed regional differences in viability of pikas.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Recently rhino horn has become a highly prized material for making carved expensive high-status items such bowls and bangles. In the past it was also used to produce ornately carved handles for ceremonial daggers (jambiyas) worn in Yemen and some Middle East countries. Historically rhino horn was also used in traditional Chinese medicine (as a fever reducer). However, most recently it appears to be shavings from carvings that are illegally sold to the medicinal market at lower prices than worked items. While Black Rhino numbers continue to increase at a continental-level poaching has slowed overall growth. Some populations have also declined. Black rhino poaching peaked in 2015 and has been declining since. See Figure 2 and Table 2 and 3 in attached Supplementary Information file.The significantly increased poaching since 2007 has greatly increased protection costs and risks to investment and staff. This has resulted in reduced incentives. Some private owners in South Africa have got rid of their rhino. If this worrying trend continues this threatens to possibly reverse the expansion of range and has the potential to also reduce conservation budgets and incentives to conserve Black Rhino privately (both those privately owned and those managed for the state on a custodianship basis (due to declining live sales and greatly increased protection costs ).

In Argentina it also includes small-scale farming and cattle ranching, and in Bolivia urban development around Santa Cruz de la Sierra. Minimal subsistence hunting occurs in Bolivia, for consumption and as bait for fishing. In Brazil, the main threats identified for the taxon were fire, agriculture, livestock keeping, urban expansion, deforestation, habitat disconnection, habitat reduction and mineral extraction. These are general threats for the taxon across its geographic range and there is no specific information available about the intensity of these threats affecting single populations (Rímoli and Rylands 2015).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

In Brazil, deforestation in Amazonas state is driven by the expansion of the agricultural frontier mainly for cattle pasture and soy-bean production (Barona et al. 2010).Studies of illegal trade in primates for Peru have regularly encountered Aotus nancymaae in markets and other forms of trafficking (Shanee et al. 2015). Although quantitative estimates do not exist, it is suspected that this trade is having a negative effect on populations in large areas of this species’ distribution.The extraction of night monkeys for malaria research is drastically affecting wild populations in the tri-border area of Brazil-Colombia-Peru. In Peru, densities range from 13.6 individuals/km2 in areas where animals are trapped (Maldonado and Peck 2014) to 46.3 individuals/km2 (Aquino and Encarnacion 1986a) where trapping does not occur. This might be the result of long‐term extraction for the biomedical research market or a result of deforestation associated with destructive trapping methods. Although the impact is likely to mimic natural gap formation, of concern is that trees with appropriate nesting holes are targeted and lost in the process, which may have long‐term impacts on night monkey population recovery (Maldonado and Peck 2014).A permit granted in 2016 for the trapping of A. nancymaae in Colombia lacks information on the population status of this species. In addition, Colombian indigenous collectors resident in Peru were allowed to be part of the team of trappers, promoting the illegal trade between Peru and Colombia (Svensson et al. 2016).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The sport harvest for this species in Canada and the U.S. totals 40,000–50,000 annually. Currently, black bears are not legally hunted in Mexico, but some conditional permits are allowed for depredation cases.  A few small, isolated populations of American black bears may be threatened with extirpation, simply due to small population size, effects of fluctuating food (and in some cases water) resources, or direct human-caused mortality. A very small (<20 black bears), isolated population in western Florida may persist only if tenuous travel corridors to other, more robust populations are made safer for bears (Larkin et al. 2004). An isolated population on a peninsula in Ontario was judged to have a high probability of extirpation unless all non-natural mortality was eliminated (Howe et al. 2007). A black bear population on a large island in Québec was extirpated apparently from introduced deer excessively browsing berry-producing shrubs, and thus eliminating an essential food supply for the resident bears (Côté 2005).  Most small, isolated populations are in the southern U.S. In a particularly dramatic case, a severe drought in 2000 prompted a number of bears from Big Bend National Park, an isolated population in southwestern Texas, to travel to Chihuahua and Coahuila, Mexico, apparently in search of better fall mast — most never returned (they either remained in Mexico, died naturally when crossing the desert, or were killed by people). As a result, the entire Big Bend population was reduced to 5–7 bears, including only 2 adult females (Hellgren et al. 2005). However, since that time, this population has rebounded to higher numbers than were there before the exodus in 2000, likely supplemented by bears immigrating from Mexico. Mexico served as the original source of the recolonization of bears in southwest Texas after they had been eradicated during the 1940s (Onorato and Hellgren 2001). Movements by bears across the seemingly harsh, xeric environment of southwestern U.S. and Mexico once appeared to be anomalous (Doan-Crider and Hellgren 1996, Onorato et al. 2004), but it is now recognized as an integral part of the ecology of bears in this region.  In 2011, northern Mexico experienced record drought and wildfires that not only caused high direct bear mortality, but also prompted immigration of bears of both sexes into unburned, previously unoccupied habitat in both Mexico and Texas.  Increased public awareness of bears and protection from human-caused mortality are likely enabling bears to successfully traverse areas of Mexico where they once would have been persecuted.  Additionally, reports of bears using deer feeders on game ranches in northern Mexico and south Texas have become commonplace, and may be playing a role in promoting bear movements and population growth.  Conversely, recently constructed barriers and human activity spurred by illegal human immigration and drug-related violence could thwart the natural interchange of bears across the U.S.–Mexican border (Atwood et al. 2011).  Conflicts with humans have been a threat to black bears since European colonization of North America (Cardoza 1976). Human–bear conflict stems from humans and bears competing for space and bears being attracted to food items produced or managed by people. Due to their generalist food habits, black bears are readily attracted to many human sources of foods, such as garbage, agricultural crops, apiaries, and sometimes livestock, especially when their preferred wild foods are scarce. People kill bears in retribution, to prevent property damage, or in fear for their safety.  Encounters between black bears and people have increased as people have encroached upon bear habitat, and as bear populations have increased and expanded into areas occupied by people.  Most states and provinces with a significant population of black bears report common or increasing conflicts between bears and people (Hristienko and McDonald 2007, Spencer et al. 2007).  Recent studies suggest that variation in abundance of natural foods tends to be a key driver of human–bear conflict levels (Howe et al. 2010, Obbard et al. 2014). Urban areas provide attractive sources of anthropogenic food for bears during periods of natural food shortages, but also are a source of increased mortality (Ryan et al. 2007, Baruch-Mordo et al. 2014). Urban areas are expected to increase across American black bear range in the future (Bierwagen et al. 2010), which, coupled with the potential frequent natural food shortages in arid bear habitats as a result of global climate change, may threaten small or isolated bear populations.  Increasing density of roads, with increasing traffic volume, is another growing threat to American black bears.  Without immigration from an adjacent national forest, bear numbers in a rural residential community in north-central Florida would have declined as a result of increased adult female mortality from vehicle collisions (Hostetler et al. 2007).  A stretch of highway in North Carolina that was upgraded from 2-lane to 4-lane, with increased speed limits and a new alignment, caused increased bear mortalities that negatively affected the nearby population, even though underpasses were made available (van Manen et al. 2012). Poor food years tend to spur wide-scale movements of black bears, resulting in increased mortalities from vehicular collisions (Wooding and Maddrey 1994).",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

There has been heavy harvest for skins in China (Lau et al. 2010) and probably to some extent elsewhere.

It is the second most commonly traded civet in Java, Indonesia, where there is a current craze for keeping civets at pets, with the mushrooming of civet-'lovers' clubs; numbers in this trade are however dwarfed by those of Common Palm Civet, with almost 20 times as many of the latter seen (Nijman et al. 2014). While hunting (including the use of traps for civets) seems to be rare in some of its range, such as Java (Rode-Margono et al. 2014), a large part of its range - North-east India, southern China and northern South-east Asia - has heavy to very heavy mammal hunting using, in great part, non-selective techniques such as snaring, for domestic consumption and, in many areas, sale into the urban and international wildlife trade. In the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh, local people kill Small Indian Civets (for meat consumption) with poison (S. Chakma per H. Rahman pers. comm. 2014). The demand for civet meat in Chinese and Viet Namese markets has increased rapidly since the 1980s (Bell et al. 2004) and remains high. This species is perhaps somewhat insulated from the heaviest pressures because such activities are mostly within closed evergreen forest, only a marginal habitat of this species. On the other hand, its use of marginal and degraded habitats means it might suffer more than do the more closed-forest associated small carnivores from retaliatory killing (as a pest of poultry), secondary accumulation of rodenticides (heavily used in some parts of its range) and killing by domestic dogs. It is reasonably clear that, in aggregate, these threats are not causing steep declines in India, Myanmar and southern China (where it remains common even though most other small carnivores are severely depleted (Lau et al. 2010); the situation is less clear in northern South-east Asia, where hunting is highest, because of the species' limited occurrence in closed evergreen forest, which hosts the majority of wildlife survey and research. It is clearly widespread even in Viet Nam and Lao PDR, but populations there are probably well below what they would be in the absence of hunting.Forest loss and degradation are unlikely to be, overall, a threat to this species; the opening-up of large areas of closed-canopy old-growth evergreen forest in South-east Asia has probably increased the total habitat availability, more than offsetting the losses from conversion of open deciduous forest to habitats supporting lower densities of this species (such forests are being lost rapidly, at present, in Cambodia and perhaps Myanmar). Its use of agriculture-dominated landscapes, while common, is poorly understood: it is quite plausible that the rapid intensification of field crop systems in Java, Thailand, Vietnam, China and, increasingly, Lao PDR and Cambodia will be reducing habitat suitability over large areas, particularly through loss of uncultivated patches: daytime resting sites in Hlawga Park, Myanmar, were typically at ground level in dense shrubby tangles (Su Su and Sale 2007); and such patches are also likely to increase food supply over that in crop monoculture.In sum, while further information would be useful in elaborating the detail of the response to the various potential threats facing this species, its continued abundance in most of its range indicates that it is well able to survive the current levels of threats.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

However, climate change may make higher elevations more suitable for agricultural expansion (see below) and thus represents an emerging threat.The effects of global climate change on the endemic Fynbos Biome of South Africa, and its interaction with land transformation has been assessed by Midgely et al. (2003), who predict the potential range contraction and elimination of certain Proteaceae species. Climate change was predicted to have more of an impact on Proteaceae species than land transformation; as land transformation was considerably less prevalent in regions of higher altitude (Midgley et al. 2003). Additionally, altered fire regimes due to climate change and the expansion of invasive alien plant species may lead to habitat degradation and fragmentation, thus affecting the availability of shelter and forage resources for this species. The fynbos habitat is impacted in parts by invasive alien plants which, despite control efforts, are expanding (van Wilgen et al. 2012). Replacement of natural vegetation by non-indigenous species may reduce food resources and lead to altered fire regimes, which may become a threat if the fire return interval becomes so short that seeds preferred by the Verreaux’s Mouse cannot be produced.Habitat is currently declining, in the lowland fynbos habitats. However, as 76% of the province remains natural or near-natural and the protected area network continues to expand (Pence 2014b), we suspect that habitat loss from agricultural expansion will only impact the species if higher-elevation areas are increasingly converted to crops, which may become likely as climate change makes such areas suitable. For example, climate change is projected to increase the suitability of upslope habitats for viticulture, increasing the footprint of winelands by 14% by 2050 (Hannah et al. 2013). Such trends in transformation of mid- and upper-slopes should be monitored.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

A reduction in quality and expanse of grassland has apparently resulted in increased fragmentation and isolation of G. arenarius populations, which already have a patchy distribution dictated by the availability of appropriate friable soil. Continued grazing and fire suppression, coupled with warming and drying trends, may further isolate the Rio Grande and Tularosa Valley populations temporarily eliminating intermediate, ephemeral populations (Hafner, in press). Habitat in the Las Cruces area has apparently been improved by Army Corps of Engineers activities. Populations are dense along the Rio Grande and adjacent agricultural fields and pasturelands in areas where the river has been channelized and the natural bosque eradicated (Hafner, in press; D. Hafner pers. comm.). According to Williams and Baker (1974), Cratogeomys castanops may have replaced G. arenarius some areas. In contrast, Hafner and Geluso (1983) found G. arenarius to be abundant in the White Sands area, while they caught relatively few Cratogeomys. Davis and Schmidly (1994) stated that this species faces no known threats but should be monitored in view of its small distribution. Hafner (pers. comm.) indicated that this species is not very threatened or is unthreatened; it is threatened only in the sense that it occupies a somewhat small range.A protected population occurs on White Sands National Monument, but it is vulnerable to droughts. Inventory needs are as follows: 1. Determine distribution and long-term dynamics of isolated populations located between the established populations (Rio Grande, White Sands, and Gran Quivira). 2. Evaluate the effect of grazing and fire suppression on intermediate populations. 3. Monitor established populations periodically to determine population dynamics. 4.

Being semi-terrestrial, this species is sensitive to ground snares (a common form of hunting in the region). Allochrocebus solatus is rarely recorded in village hunting catches, but this may be due to its preference for more mature forest habitat, or to past hunting having already reduced densities close to villages. Habitat loss and/or degradation, mainly due to logging, including in the Forêt des Abeilles, which is largely allocated to logging concessions, is also a threat (Gautier and Brugière 2013).All records of this taxon fall within an unbroken forest extent without biogeographic barriers.

Pucek (1991, 1994) has summarized the history of their extinction. Among the primary reasons for the rapid decrease of the European bison population in Białowieża Primeval Forest at the beginning of 19th century was the over-population of deer species, and the drastic reduction of natural food resources for herbivores which followed (Wróblewski 1927). During the period of World War I and the Russian Revolution of 1917, conflict and heavy poaching exacted a severe toll on remaining populations (Pucek et al. 2004). Conflict and political instability continues to be a threat to the species in the Caucasus, where reintroduced free-living herds have suffered very severe losses (leading to extinctions) in recent years (Pucek et al. 2004). Other current threats include lack of appropriate habitat, fragmentation of populations (and concomitant loss of genetic diversity), inbreeding depression, disease, hybridisation, and poaching. There is little space for a large herbivore such as the European bison in Europe's contemporary ecosystems, especially in the west. The most significant limit for the enlargement of European bison populations is human population density; forestry and agricultural activity is not a limiting factor. Fragmentation and isolation of free-ranging (and captive) herds result in little or no exchange of genetic material. Small isolated populations quickly lose their genetic heterogeneity and are more vulnerable to extinction (Franklin 1980). As yet, the opportunity to reconstruct a more compact geographic range to facilitate migration of bison between herds does not exist. As a consequence of passing a dramatic bottleneck (the current population descends from just 12 founder animals), the gene pool is limited and animals are highly inbred. The average inbreeding coefficient is very high compared to other large mammals, and is equal to 44% in the Lowland line and 26% in the Lowland-Caucasian line for individuals with a full pedigree (Olech 1998). The negative effects of inbreeding, manifested in the decline in reproduction rate, are more strongly pronounced in the Lowland-Caucasian line than in the Lowland line (Olech 1987, 1989, 1998). Inbreeding exerts a harmful effect on skeleton growth, particularly in females (Kobryńczuk 1985), and possibly lowers the resistance of bison to disease and pathologies.Diseases appearing in European bison populations can bring serious threats to the whole species. It is not certain whether the species has always shown a weak resistance to disease or if immunity has declined, due to limited genetic heterogeneity.  The most important disease affects the male reproductive organs and is manifested in the inflammation of the penis and prepuce, leading to diphtheroid-necrotic lesions, diagnosed as balanoposthitis. This disease was discovered at the beginning of the 1980s in Białowieża Forest (Kita et al. 1995, Piusiński et al. 1997, Jakob et al. 2000); although similar symptoms had been reported earlier (Korochkina and Kochko 1982) in Russia and Ukraine (Krasochko et al. 1997). Despite many years of study, its pathogenesis has not yet been elucidated. Other diseases that are potentially major threats to herds include foot-and-mouth disease Aphte epizooticae (to which the species is known to be sensitive) (Podgurniak 1967), and tuberculosis (Żórawski and Lipiec 1997, Welz et al. 2005).A particular problem concerning the management of extant populations of European bison is the existence of hybrid herds, especially European × American bison hybrids living in the Caucasus. Two free-living hybrid herds have been established in the Caucasus Mountains, in close proximity to reintroduced free-living herds of the pure blood Lowland-Caucasian line. There are fears that all these animals will crossbreed, creating a mixture of various genotypes. According to Russian authors, the distances between herds are not so great, but the configuration of mountain ridges and valleys make it impossible for contact between them. There are also two small semi-free herds of European and American bison hybrids in Toksove Forest Park (St Petersburg) and the Mordovia Wildlife Reserve (Pucek et al. 2004). Finally, poaching as a result of administrative disorders and a failure to enforce nature conservancy law threatens free-living herds of European bison in many countries.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Preliminary studies suggest a reduced level of genetic diversity for pygmy sloths compared to its putative population of origin, the common sloth population from mainland Panama. This is expected, considering the history of species diversification and isolation on the island. However, signs of a more recent population bottleneck were also detected (Silva et al. 2010, N. Moraes-Barros pers. comm. 2013). These results highlight the need of a continuous evaluation of the population status, trends, and additional studies considering a possible scenario of endogamic depression if the (already low) population size decreases any further.Despite having been designated as a protected landscape through a governmental resolution in 2009, a number of domestic and international efforts have been mounted to develop tourism infrastructure on the island. This includes plans for an eco-lodge, a casino, a marina, and a banking centre. The current status of the island’s custody is vague; a governmental resolution, and thus the protected status of the island, cannot be revoked, but no government staff has been appointed specifically to enforce protection of the island. Ongoing disagreements between the local Ngäbe bugle Comarca, regional politicians, and the Panamanian government are further complicating long-term protection of the island and the pygmy sloths.

Large cave-roosting bats are desirable targets for subsistence hunting in PNG because it is sometimes possible to kill many animals in a short period of time, especially if shotguns are available. The population at Luplupwintem was apparently decimated by groups of hunters with shotguns in the late 1970s. The closely-related Dobsonia moluccensis has been observed to abandon a cave roost after a hunting event, presumably to relocate elsewhere in one or more alternative roosts (K.P. Aplin, pers. obs.).The likelihood of hunting and roost visitation is increased with the development of new roads. Wopkaimin landowners interviewed by Ken Aplin in 2013 reported an increase in the volume of foot traffic between the Telefomin Valley to the north of the Hindenburg Range and Tabubil to the south, and they voiced concerns that this might lead to increased visitation to Luplupwintem, including visits not authorised by landowners. The same informants also mentioned a regular foot traffic across the nearby and largely unpatrolled international border with Papua Province of Indonesia, some it associated with the sale of airguns and ammunition, and potentially of other weapons.Conditions that adversely affect feeding habitat on a broad-scale have the potential to reduce the usage of local cave roosts. Forests on the Hindenburg Range in the vicinity of Luplupwintem suffered die-back during the El Nino drought of 1997–1998 and some areas were further affected by subsequent wildfires. A large wildfire had swept just north of the Luplupwintem area shortly before 2001 (T.F. Flannery pers. comm.).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Although this species can adapt to low-level habitat disturbance (if some dense undergrowth remains and inter-tree distances are not too great), major forest conversion to intensive and/or industrial agriculture is likely to eliminate it because of its weak capacity to disperse. Such forest destruction is increasing dramatically in many parts of its range, and especially in eastern Nigeria, as the human population continues to grow and economic development intensifies. For instance, in the period 1990–2015, Nigeria suffered an estimated 59.4% loss of forest cover, while the loss in Cameroon was 22.6%; in 1990–2000 the rate of forest loss was 2.7% per annum in Nigeria compared with 0.9% per annum in Cameroon, but in 2010–2015 these rates had increased to 5.0% per annum in Nigeria 1.1% per annum in Cameroon (FAO 2015). As other wildlife has declined, hunting pressure on smaller mammals has increased, and angwantibos now feature in many bushmeat reports (Svensson and Friant 2014, Svensson et al. 2016). In some areas they may also be killed when encountered because they are considered a bad omen (E.L. Gadsby pers. comm. 2016), and they feature in small quantities in trade as pets and for body parts (Svensson and Friant 2014, Svensson et al. 2015).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Although not considered the primary cause of decline, as the spatio-temporal pattern did not closely match the pipistrelle’s decline, a series of recent population explosions of Yellow Crazy Ants (Anoplolepis gracilipes) is likely to have led to some habitat change, likely decline in invertebrate prey resources, and may also have disturbed individuals at roost sites. It is also possible that some disease may have contributed to the decline, however, individuals captured over the period of decline appeared to be in good health, with the exception of low white blood cell counts, although the significance of these findings was unclear (Lumsden et al. 2007).

However, a major drainage project would pose a major threat if this were realized in the region. Burning of the remaining marshlands takes place to catch fish and to graze cattle. The resulting increase in aquatic plants is choking fishing areas and driving further burning and may also limit marsh regeneration after flooding. Hunting for food and capture for pets also have reduced its numbers through the years. Local people employ a variety of hunting and trapping methods. Direct pursuit by dogs is the most common, but they may also be captured by using a harpoon, a snare, a stick to knock them out or into the water, or by burning their reed bed habitat, causing them to flee into the hands of waiting hunters.

Sixty percent of all land above 3,200 m has been converted into farmland, and all populations below 3,700 m are particularly vulnerable to further habitat loss, especially if the areas are small and of relatively flat relief (Marino 2003a). Habitat loss is exacerbated by overgrazing of highland pastures by domestic livestock, and in some areas habitat is threatened by proposed development of commercial sheep farms and roads. Human persecution triggered by political instability in the past is currently less severe and associated with conflicts over livestock losses (Marino 2003a). Recent population decline in Bale has been mostly due to disease epizootics, with road kills and shooting as secondary threats. Rabies is a potential threat to all populations, with canine distemper also a concern in Bale. Most of these threats are exacerbated by the wolves' specialization to life in the Afroalpine ecosystem. In Bale, the Ethiopian wolf hybridizes with domestic dogs (Canis familiaris). Gottelli et al. (1994) used mitochondrial DNA restriction fragments and microsatellite alleles to conclude that hybridization was relatively common in western Bale as a result of crosses between female wolves and male domestic dogs. Hybrids have shorter muzzles, heavier-built bodies and different coat patterns. Although hybrids are confined to the Web Valley in western Bale they may threaten the genetic integrity of the wolf population. Following hybridization, a population may be affected by outbreeding depression or reduction in fitness, although to date this does not seem to have taken place in Bale. Currently there is no indication of hybridization taking place outside western Bale.  There is no exploitation of the species for furs, body parts or other purposes.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

However, effective law enforcement, and habitat and wildlife management techniques during the mid-1900s helped Pronghorn stage a remarkable recovery (Yoakum 1968).Today, there are no major range-wide threats, although localized declines are taking place, particularly to the Sonoran Pronghorn, mainly as a result of, among others, livestock grazing, the construction of roads, fences and other barriers that pose barriers to historical habitat, illegal hunting (mainly in Mexico), insufficient forage and water, and lack of recruitment (see U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1998 for review).

The distribution along rivers may make this taxon relatively more vulnerable to human impact, while specialist habitat and feeding requirements may result in greater sensitivity to habitat disturbance. Cacajao c. calvus:Although this subspecies is rarely hunted in its range because its appearance is considered too human-like (Ayres 1986), the main threat facing this primate is the reduction and transformation of its flooded forest habitat. The main forms of deforestation in the area, are small-scale agriculture and logging (Ayres and Johns 1987). Current data indicate that almost the entire (confirmed) population are included within the Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve and population densities appear to have increased in the 20 years up to 2005 (Ayres 1986; Paim 2005).Cacajao c. rubicundus:This species is hunted for food. It may be affected by habitat loss due to logging and forest loss especially along the main stream of the Amazon. Cacajao c. ucayalii:Surveys conducted between 1979 and 1986 (Aquino 1988) showed that the range was much reduced, hunting having exterminated the species in several areas. Aquino (1988) suggests that populations close to the Ucayali and Amazon Rivers have been greatly reduced and in some areas exterminated, caused by hunting and habitat disturbance. The Yavarí River and its tributary the Yaquerana represent the stronghold for remaining populations. Close to Iquitos, Mauritia flexuosa is extracted in large quantities by felling the palms (Bodmer et al. 1999; Meyer and Penn 2003); the unsustainable extraction of this resource may have an impact on Cacajao c. ucayalii in some areas (Bowler 2007). Logging concessions designated in 2004 cover around one-third of the geographic range of Cacajao c. ucayalii. While the selective removal of low-density, high-value timber species does not appear likely to have a great impact on populations of Cacajao c. ucayalii, the logging operations increase human populations and bushmeat hunting in remote parts of the range (Bowler 2007). Hunting levels on the Yavarí-Mirín and Yavarí have increased since 2004, when human populations increased due to logging activities. Bodmer et al. (2006) found that more wild meat was consumed per capita in a commercial forest concession on the Yavarí than in the nearby rural communities.Cacajao c. novaesi:This subspecies is affected to some degree by hunting and the exploitation of natural resources within the two extractive reserves where it occurs.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Ill-conceived government-organized translocation schemes of langur groups, coming into conflict with man, pose a threat to taxon survival and overall biodiversity. According to government data, during one 42-year period (1956-1993), the country has lost 50% of its forest cover, and more than 50% if the subsequent 10 years (1994-2003) is included.  There is a 1:1 relationship between loss of critical habitat and population number. There is also a local trade for meat for food and pelage for making drums at village level for subsistence.Trachypithecus vetulus monticola: deforestation, fragmentation and habitat loss (crop plantation, development, human settlement) and hunting for subsistence or small scale cash. According to government data, during one 42-year period (1956-1993), the country has lost 50% of its forest cover, and more than 50% if the subsequent 10 years (1994-2003) is included.  In addition, 80% of hill country forests were lost to tea plantations in the 19th century.  There is a close relationship between loss of critical habitat and population number.  There exists a local and domestic trade for meat and skin. Locally pocketed and isolated groups are prone to extinction due to village-level subsistence exploitation.Trachypithecus vetulus nestor: crop plantations, development (infrastructure, industry), human settlement, deforestation, fragmentation, illegal trade for food, pylon collision, and habitat loss. There is also a local trade at village level for meat, but it is not significant.Trachypithecus vetulus philbricki: shifting agriculture, deforestation, human settlement, development, hunting for food, habitat loss, and occasional cyclones in far northeastern areas of range. According to government data, during one 42-year period (1956-1993), the country has lost 50% of its forest cover, and more than 50% if the subsequent 10 years (1994-2003) is included.  The Mahaweli Development Scheme after 1978 had further reduced available habitat for this taxon. There is a close relationship between loss of critical habitat and population numbers.

Introduced rats and mice are also a concern, but to a lesser degree than introduced predators. These same threats apply to varying degrees to the reintroduced populations. Extreme fluctuations in populations on islands are a threat, but this threat is seen as minor relative to the risk exotic predators being introduced (Short et al. 1997). It is also unclear to what extent population fluctuations occur at the reintroduction sites on the mainland. This species would likely qualify as having ""extreme fluctuations"" in population in terms of the IUCN criteria (IUCN 2001) if it were still restricted to the islands off of Western Australia. This is because these fluctuations are tied to climatic extremes that are likely to be synchronous in these locations, but unlikely to be in synchrony with fluctuations (should they occur) in reintroduced populations in South Australia and New South Wales.Presumably, overgrazing of suitable habitat by cattle and rabbits, loss of wooded areas to agriculture, as well as changes to the fire regime contributed to the decline of the species on mainland Australia. Introduced species, particularly feral cats and foxes, are thought also to have led to its mainland demise (Richards 2005). Feral cats are a proven threat to this species, as they predated on all animals in a trial reintroduction in the Gibson Desert, Western Australia (A. Burbidge pers. comm.). It is believed to have been extirpated from Dirk Hartog Island by foxes and/or feral cats (Burbidge and Short 2008). The role of disease is unclear, but may have been a historical threat.Black Rats were a historical threat to the species on Boodie Island. It suffered greater losses, however, due to a rat-baiting program that accidentally eradicated the species from island in 1985. In 1993 the species was reintroduced to Boodie Island from Barrow Island (Morris 2002).",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

This species has historically been exploited locally. Its meat is consumed as a source of protein locally (e.g., in India, Kanagavel et al. 2016) and its scales have been used in whole or powdered form in the preparation of traditional medicines and as curios in Pakistan (Roberts 1977). There is evidence that the species is being severely impacted in Pakistan i.e. directly targeted and killed so the scales can be removed and illegally exported to China and it is suspected that this has caused local extirpations (Mahmood et al. 2012). In India, hunting of pangolins has been recorded in Arunachal Pradesh, and specifically regarding the Indian Pangolin hunting/poaching is known to occur Periyar Tiger reserve (Kerala), the Western Ghats and eastern states of India including Odisha (Mitra 1998, Misra and Hanfee 2000; Gubbi and Linkie 2012). There are also reports of the involvement of tribal communities such as Padhis, Saperas, Bawarias and Mongias in the capture of pangolins (Sharma 2014) and pangolin scales have reportedly increased in price (prior to export) in India in the last 20 years (Chinlampianga et al. 2013). The meat, bile, scales and claws of pangolins are reportedly used by tribal communities including the Paaudi Bhuanya tribe of Odisha, Biate tribe of Assam, Katkaris folk of Maharashtra, Gond tribe of Madhya Pradesh, and Mizo ethnic group of Mizoram (Mohapatra et al. 2015). D'Cruze et al. (2018) report that pangolins, both Chinese and Indian species continue to be hunted and consumed locally, but the scales are illegally exported because of the high financial returns available.There has been limited trade in this species reported to CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (see Challender and Waterman 2017). However, the species has been trafficked since at least the early 2000s for consumptive use in China (Wu and Ma 2007). International trafficking today primarily involves scales, which are sourced from all range states, including Sri Lanka, and are primarily destined for China. The scales are either shipped directly (e.g., by post) or are trafficked along routes through Myanmar and Nepal (Mahmood et al. 2012, Challender and Waterman 2017, Heinrich et al. 2017, Perera et al. 2017). It is estimated that between 2011 and 2017 at least 1724 Indian Pangolin were trafficked internationally (Challender and Waterman 2017) though the actual number involved is likely much higher. This is partly because of low detection rates associated with illegal wildlife trade and because the species of pangolin involved in wildlife trafficking are rarely identified. Challender et al. (2019) report that between 2000 and 2018, a combination of live animals, dead individuals and parts and derivatives equating to an estimated 300,000 Asian pangolins were trafficked globally. Trafficking in the Indian Pangolin may be related to declines in populations of the Chinese and Sunda Pangolins, and potentially increasing awareness of the monetary value of scales (D’Cruze et al. 2018). Other threats include the expansion of agriculture, habitat loss and deterioration, which opens up previously inaccessible areas to hunting and poaching, pesticide use and roadkill (Karawita et al. 2018, Murthy and Mishra 2010).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Habitat fragmentation, reduced prey base and conflict with livestock and game farming have reduced Leopard populations throughout most of their range (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Ray et al. 2005, Hunter et al. 2013). The conversion of forest habitats and savanna systems to agriculture, livestock farming and urban sprawl have significantly reduced Leopard range. Though exceptions exist (Athreya et al. 2013), this conversion typically leads to the depletion of natural prey species through poaching thereby reducing the natural prey base in these areas.Where livestock and game farms have been created, Leopards may feed on these commercially valuable prey causing conflicts with farmers. These farmers may be intolerant to Leopard conflict and kill the Leopards for real or perceived threats to their lives and livelihoods (Stein et al. 2010, Athreya et al. 2011). Recent reports from northern Iraq suggest unsustainable levels of Leopard removal (Raza et al. 2012b).Leopards are also targets for trophy hunting. If poorly managed, trophy hunting can be detrimental to the population, especially when permits are focused in one geographic area and targeted individuals are in their prime, territorial, reproductively active (Balme et al. 2010). Leopard trophy hunting has been reviewed or closed in Namibia, Botswana, and Zambia within the last five years.In Indo-Malaya and China, Leopards require better protection from illegal trade in skins and bones (Nowell 2007) and recent reports estimate very high levels of Leopard removal at four individuals per week for 10 years (Raza et al. 2012b). Leopards are also killed for their skins in traditional ceremonies and other parts for medicinal use in eastern cultures. These trades can have a substantial impact on local Leopard populations.In the face of changing land-use, prey availability and direct mortality from humans, Leopards have persisted where other large predators have not. Their ability to live within human-dominated landscapes and feed on a variety of prey have given many people the impression that Leopards require little concern, however, recent trends have shown that current threats have substantially reduced Leopard populations throughout West and Central Africa, South-west and South-east Asia and China.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Unlike other Otomys species threatened by climate change (Taylor et al. 2016), population increases in Lesotho are the result of better overwintering of O. sloggetti as a consequence of warmer minimum temperatures over the past two decades (Mokotjomela et al. 2010). Overgrazing the vegetation by domestic livestock and O. sloggetti themselves around wetlands reduces habitat suitability.  This species inhabits high-altitude areas that are unlikely to be transformed significantly. However, overgrazing may reduce habitat quality and this should be monitored. Another important consideration is that the increasing population sizes contribute greatly to habitat change through vegetation loss and consequent soil erosion (Grab and Deschamps 2004). Experimental plots erected in the Sani Valley to investigate the single or combined effects of O. sloggetti and domestic livestock on soil erosion and loss showed that the damage caused by O. sloggetti exceeds that of livestock (Mokotjomela et al. 2009). Therefore, while low temperature and prolonged snowfall are density independent regulators of O. sloggetti populations in Lesotho, diminishing resources (food and suitable nest sites) are possible density-dependent regulators. Correspondingly, an increase in population densities may accelerate soil erosion rates through their feeding and burrowing habits (Mokotjomela et al. 2009).",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Canalization of rivers, removal of bank side vegetation, dam construction, draining of wetlands, aquaculture activities and associated man-made impacts on aquatic systems are all unfavourable to otter populations (Reuther and Hilton-Taylor 2004). In south and southeast Asia, the decrease in prey species from wetlands and water ways had reduced the population to an unsustainable threshold leading to local extinctions. Poaching is one of the main causes of its decline in south and southeast Asia, and possibly also in north Asia.Pollution is major threat to the otters in western and central Europe, the main pollutants posing a danger to otters are the organochlorines dieldrin (HEOD) and DDT/DDE, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and the heavy metal mercury. Coastal populations are particularly vulnerable to oil spills. Acidification of rivers and lakes results in the decline of fish biomass and reduces the food resources of the otters. The same effects are known to result from organic pollution by nitrate fertilizers, untreated sewage, or farm slurry.In addition, major causes of mortality from range countries are drowning and road kills. Fyke nets set for eels or for fish as well as creels set for marine crustaceans have a great attraction to otters and a high risk to those that successfully try to enter these traps.A further potential threat is strangulation by transparent, monofilament drift net. A potential risk comes from traps designed to kill other species, especially underwater cages constructed to drown muskrats. Illegal hunting is still a problem in many parts of their distribution range. In several European countries political pressure especially by fishermen has resulted in granting of licenses for killing otters (Reuther and Hilton-Taylor 2004).There is an ongoing discussion about the problem of reintroduction of otters. In recent years it is feared that it may contaminate the genetic structure of the native population (Mason 1992, Reuther 1998).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

This rapid habitat loss is exacerbated by a growing, poor population engaged in unsustainable agricultural activity (Rowe-Rowe 1990, 1992, 1995) and unsustainable fishing practices (LVFO 2008). These practices have led to bank and shoreline erosion, denuding of important vegetative cover used by the otters, increased human presence which is disruptive to otter denning, increased use of smaller mesh nets and poisoning to improve catches, and the change or depletion of the otters prey base (Kruuk and Goudswaard 1990). Pollution of waters with agricultural, livestock, and societal wastes also are threatening with evidence of the bioaccumulation of organochlorines and other biocontaminants recorded in Spotted-necked Otters (Mason and Rowe-Rowe 1992). The rate of otters becoming entangled in set and discarded fishing nets is impossible to determine. However, based on known entanglement of other species it has likely increased over the occasional drowning reported previously (Stuart 1985, Rowe-Rowe 1990).Otters are also killed for food or skins, as a perceived threat to poultry, or as a competitor for fish (Rowe-Rowe 1990, Akpuna et al. 2011, Reed-Smith et al. 2010). Introduction of alien fish species that out-compete the smaller indigenous fish was identified as a main threat for the Lake Victoria population (Kruuk and Goudswaard 1990).Habitat loss and increased conflict with people is impacting all populations. The increase in human numbers dependent on fish as a source of protein is particularly threatening in the large East African lakes which are historically important refugia for this species. It has been reported that the introduction of Nile Perch into Lake Victoria and their impact on the diversity of the fish biomass in the lake is forcing a dietary shift for the otters (Kruuk and Goudswaard 1990). This shift in prey base has been observed (Reed-Smith 2010) but its full impact is unknown at this time particularly for areas outside of the protected national park where recent studies have occurred. The introduction of invasive alien species such as water  hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) is also degrading the water ecosystem.The impact of global climate change throughout Africa (Magadza 1994, Dixon et al. 2003, Hendrix and Glaser 2007) also has the potential of decreasing suitable habitat for otters and increasing human/otter conflict for increasingly scarce resources such as water, land, and fish. UNECA projected in a 1999 study that portions of the Spotted-necked Otter’s current range would be experiencing fresh water stress and scarcity by 2025 with much of the rest of its range considered vulnerable to these hydrologic issues.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

Whereas the importance of this factor as a threat for Iberian Lynx has decreased (Ferreras et al. 2010), during the last years some lynx have been shot or caught with illegal traps (Iberlince LIFE Project 2014). Road casualties typically produce several losses each year (Simón et al. 2012, Iberlince LIFE Project 2014), as the length of paved or widened roads, as well as average traffic loads, have significantly increased in and around lynx areas (Ferreras et al. 2010).Homogenization of mosaic cultural landscapes due to agricultural and silvicultural intensification during the 20th century conceivably contributed to lynx decline (Rodríguez and Delibes 2002, Ferreras et al. 2010). Continued trends of abandonment of marginal livestock farming and loss of small game, sometimes followed by afforestation, further reduce the amount of potentially suitable habitat for reintroduction. Without viable land uses, maintaining suitable mosaic landscapes for the Iberian Lynx would require enduring and expensive intensive management (Rodríguez 2013). Even in landscapes with suitable structure and subject to intensive conservation management, rabbit abundance exhibits large temporal variability closely tracked by the probability of lynx breeding (Palomares et al. 2001, Fernández et al. 2007, Iberlince LIFE project undated).Effective population size does not exceed 25 for each isolated subpopulation (Casas-Marcé et al. 2013), announcing further losses of genetic diversity and accumulation of inbreeding through genetic drift. Indeed, persistent small population size over lynx generations, especially in the lowlands of the Doñana region, have produced signs of both demographic and genetic deterioration, including biased sex-ratios, decreased age of territory acquisition and litter size, and increased mortality due to disease and other natural causes (Palomares et al. 2012). Lowered demographic and genetic performance could positively interact in the form of an extinction vortex (Palomares et al. 2012).As a manifestation of global change, human-assisted spread of virulent diseases affecting European Rabbits had catastrophic effects on Iberian Lynx populations in the past (Ferreras et al. 2010). Although rabbits could eventually develop resistance, viral diseases remain a recurrent threat as the arrival of new strains may cause again a lasting depression of food availability for the Iberian Lynx. Moreover, the prevalent rabbit lineage in southwestern Iberia, where rabbit restocking and other conservation measures take place, might be more vulnerable to rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) than the northeastern lineage (Real et al. 2009). For example, a new RHD strain has been blamed for an annual 62% decrease in productivity (average number of kittens per territorial female) in Andújar-Cardeña subpopulation (Iberlince LIFE project, undated). Likewise, diseases affecting felids also spread, sometimes with the help of uncontrolled pets that become feral or visit lynx areas from nearby towns. For example, in 2007 a feline leukaemia outbreak killed a substantial fraction of lynx in Doñana (López et al. 2009, Palomares et al. 2011a). Finally, detailed models combining ecological niche and metapopulation dynamics show that, without intensive intervention, climate change will rapidly decrease lynx populations and would probably lead to Iberian Lynx to extinction within 35 years (Fordham et al. 2013).",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Of particular and concern is the recent increase in Bobcat pelt prices from $85 in 2000, to record highs of $589 in 2013,  $447 in 2014, and $305 in 2015, driven by high demand for fur in China, Europe, and Russia (Knudson 2016). The number of Bobcat pelts exported from the U.S. has quadrupled in recent years, climbing to a high of 65,000 in 2013 when pelt prices were highest. The US government has found that trade is not detrimental to Bobcat survival and is well-managed by state authorities. They have petitioned CITES numerous times, most recently in 2007, to remove the Bobcat from the CITES Appendices, arguing that the Bobcat does not meet the biological criteria for CITES listing and that their research indicates that importing governments should be able to reliably distinguish Bobcat skins from other species to prevent illegal trade (Govt of US 2007). However, the proposal was rejected by majority vote of the Parties to CITES (Nowell et al. 2007).Habitat loss is viewed as another primary threat to bobcats in all three range countries. Increasing urbanization results in direct habitat loss when human density is high, although Bobcats have proven to be fairly adaptive to urbanization (Ordenana et al. 2010, Tracey et al. 2013 ) and low density developments (one house per two acres), particularly in areas with landscaped green spaces and golf courses, and Bobcats have been documented denning and raising litters in human structures (Riley et al. 2010). However, as Bobcats adjust to human developed landscapes, indirect effects increase. Vehicle collisions can be a primary source of mortality in urban Bobcat populations (Riley et al. 2006) and in populations with a high proportion of transients (Blankenship et al. 2006). In addition, exposure to common rodenticides in urban landscapes can result in direct mortality (anticoagulant toxicosis) and increased susceptibility to severe notoedric mange resulting in the death of Bobcats (Riley 1999, Riley et al. 2003, Riley et al. 2006,  Riley et al. 2007, Ruell et al. 2009, Serieys et al. 2013). Increases in urbanization and roads have also resulted in recent genetic isolation of Bobcats populations in several areas, indicating human developments are affecting historic dispersal patterns and gene flow, resulting in local and regional population structure (Riley et al. 2003, Croteau et al. 2012, Ruell et al. 2012, but see Millions and Swanson 2007).  There is concern in the northeastern US about interspecific competition with expanding coyote populations (Moruzzi et al. 2002, Litvaitis and Harrison 1989, Litvaitis et al. 2006). However, in Florida, where Coyotes have also increased, Thornton et al. (2004) found that Bobcats and Coyotes favoured different prey species, with coyotes taking larger ungulates and Bobcats rodents and smaller mammals, and Coyotes and Bobcats coexist throughout most of the western portions of their ranges, likely through niche shifts in diet and activity (Fedriani et al. 2000). Bobcats coexist with Ocelots in Texas (Horne et al. 2009) and Canada Lynx in zones of sympatry (Peers et al. 2013) through habitat partitioning. Aside from exploitative competition, there is evidence of interference competition through intraspecific killing by Mountain Lions (Haas 2009) and hybridization has been detected with few federally threatened Canada Lynx (Lynx canadensis) in Maine, Minnesota, and New Brunswick (Homyack et al. 2008). In addition, increased or novel sources of depredation in have been documented in several areas.  Bobcat observations in southern Florida have decreased dramatically as invasive python densities have increased (Dorcas et al. 2012). In Ventura County, California, Coyotes were found to be the leading source of Bobcat kitten mortality (Moriarty 2007), although this increase in predation pressure is likely a result of reduced avoidance options in highly fragmented urban habitat (Riley et al. 2003). Interactions with domestic dogs may also present threats to the Bobcat population. Canine distemper and canine distemper-associated encephalitis has been documented in Bobcats in eastern Canada (Daoust et al. 2009) validating the proposed role of dogs as a pathogen-mediated apparent competitor with Bobcats (Vanek and Gompper 2009), and several studies demonstrate negative correlation between domestic dog activity and Bobcat activity (George and Crooks 2006, Reed and Merenlender 2011).  In localized areas Bobcats take domestic livestock and are persecuted as pests (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). In addition, there have been recent concerns about the effects of harvest on local Bobcat populations in West Virginia (WV-DNR), and Michigan (Preuss and Gehring 2007) and poaching may result in higher harvest rates than anticipated in some areas (Millions and Swanson 2006), which can result in population declines as it has in New Hampshire (Litviatus et al. 2006). However, there is evidence from a survey of state game management agencies that Bobcat populations are stable or increasing, with densities greater than initially estimated, in all US states with the exception of Florida (Roberts and Crimmins 2010).",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Because of the growth in the livestock industry over the past 40 years in Taiwan, food from wildlife is becoming less and less important and hunting serow is now banned throughout Taiwan. However, wild meat is still preferred over livestock meat in certain situations such as ceremonies or gifts. Better economic conditions may also increase the demand for wild meat. Wild meat is still taken through illegal hunting and hunting activity seems to have increased in recent years, partially because the immigration of foreign workers into Taiwan have caused unemployment among the indigenous people, who have returned to their villages and now practice hunting for a living. Nevertheless, current hunting pressure still seems lower compared to several decades ago. It is unknown whether current hunting pressure has a significant adverse effects on serow populations. In addition, forestry, agricultural, road construction activities in the mountainous regions have encroached upon the virgin forests originally inhabited by serow. The latest threat to serow comes from increasing recreational and tourist pressures, but the impact is unknown. Mortality related to skin parasites have also been reported (Pei and Chiang 2004, Tsai 2005) and confirmed (Chen and Pei 2007) and could be a potential threat to the serow populations in Taiwan.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Habitat loss primarily from agricultural expansion, but also piecemeal clearance for firewood and timber is also a serious long-term threat in some areas. It is threatened at least locally because habitat is rapidly being lost to deforestation and land clearing. In 1962, a die-off caused by an unknown epizootic was reported in the Tangjiahe area (Qingchuan County, Sichuan).The main threats to serow in Cambodia are posed by hunting, and to a lesser degree habitat loss, but the species is relatively safe in this country compared to other range states. In Lao PDR, serow horns, frontal bones, leg bones and other body parts are used in local, traditional medicine and are readily available in shops in Vientiane and elsewhere. The meat is also eaten in rural areas; however, the extent to which hunting affects the population status of this species in Lao PDR is unknown. In Viet Nam, serow is frequently hunted for meat and for sale as live individuals in many local markets, while its bones and other body parts are valued for medicinal purposes (TRAFFIC, 1993).

The serow in Myanmar is one of the most heavily traded species in the local trade.  Every market surveyed by TRAFFIC in Myanmar in 2006 had Serow, and in most markets, this was the most commonly observed species, with the bulk of the parts observed being horns and heads. Many of these markets are situated on the Myanmar-Thailand border and dealers claim that all buyers in these border markets come from Thailand, indicating a blatant disregard for both national legislation and CITES. Serows are protected throughout Southeast Asia by law, but protecting this species on the ground does not appear to be a priority in many countries.Serow are very heavily hunted in Myanmar, with meat usually being consumed locally, but parts, including the forelegs, heads, horns and fat from the stomach region being the most sought after for use in traditional medicines.  These parts are rendered down and the oil is sold in small bottles.  According to dealers, this oil is applied externally to treat skin ailments and joint problems.  Horn tips are also exported from Myanmar to Thailand to be attached to the spurs of fighting cocks (this is believed to give them more power).In 2006, interviews with dealers in border markets and markets in the centre of Myanmar, revealed that in all areas surveyed, Serow are apparently in decline.

Oliver pers. comm. and unpubl.). Hunting was particularly severe during the mid-1970s (Grimwood 1976), but seemingly declined in most areas during the 1980s and 1990s, except on Calauit where hunting pressure increased dramatically following the resettlement of the island by former residents under the auspices of the ‘Balik (Back to) Calauit Movement’. In 1986, 51 out of the 256 families evicted from the island ten years earlier had re-settled on the island, and by 1992 the settlers numbered nearly 500 people (Oliver 1993, W. Oliver pers. comm.). Much of the hunting of the species is recreational, and also to provide venison to the local markets (W. Oliver pers. comm.). More recently, pressure on the habitat has increased (and presumably hunting pressure also), due to resettlements of victims of typhoon Haiyan, and squatting of outsiders in Busuanga (P. Widmann pers. comm. 2014). On Calauit, introduced African ungulate populations are increasing but are probably not competing with Calamian Deer (Calauit was originally stocked with giraffe, zebra, impala, waterbuck, gazelle, eland, topi and bushbuck acquired from Kenya). A presidential proclamation that precluded removal or control of exotic species, and the movement or management of Calamian Deer on Calauit Island was recently amended, thereby also potentially enabling the better future control of the exotic ungulate populations, though in fact many of these populations have also been seriously reduced by poaching.

Several problems occur throughout the species's range, albeit with some variation in assessed impact. The major threats are habitat loss and fragmentation; habitat degradation; and physical threats. These are all compounded by the region's increasing human population; climate change; natural disasters; inadequate enforcement of laws and regulations; mostly low political will and interest; political instability (in some regions); low coordination of stakeholders, funding and human resources; trans-boundary issues facilitating poaching, illegal collection of non-timber forest products, and Red Panda trade (skins and other body parts); and the movement of cattle herders/grazers during the breeding season.  Natural disasters include cyclones; landslides; floods; heavy snowfall and rainfall; bamboo flowering (which results in death of the plant and typically occurs synchronously across large areas); forest fires; poor regeneration of shelter trees; weed infestation and invasive alien species; and disease outbreaks. Although most of these have been in operation throughout Red Panda existence, their effects are increasingly severe as an ever-larger proportion of the distribution is outside contiguous habitat blocks large enough for recolonisation to occur post-disaster. In some areas, habitat is lost and degraded by commercial logging. In the Emaw Bum region of Myanmar more than 5,000 km2 have been logged since 1999–2000, resulting in many new roads into mountain areas, e.g. between the May Hka river and the China border. These logging roads not only destroy habitat directly, they also facilitate access for hunters and can destabilise the substrate. A recent video report from FFI shows two young Red Pandas crossing a landslide, the result of foreign road-building in the area.  As human populations grow, more people move into mountain regions to live. They clear land for habitation, bring domestic herds to roam in the forests where they trample and eat bamboo. Herders collect bamboo for fodder and other necessities. The herds are protected by dogs that attack pandas and, if not vaccinated, potentially carry canine distemper, fatal to Red Panda. The lack of annual vaccination in India, at least, leads to a high incidence of canine distemper in dogs of one to five years of age (Latha et al. 2007). Spillover of canine distemper into wild species is already well documented, such as to Indian Fox Vulpes bengalensis (Vanak et al. 2007) and Tiger Panthera tigris (e.g. Goodrich et al. 2012).  Himalayan bamboos, the Red Panda’s dietary staple, are sensitive to environmental degradation, deforestation, fire and overgrazing (Stapleton 1996). Reduced canopy cover increases wind and water stress for the bamboo. In these situations, seedlings are destroyed by the harsh conditions coupled with grazing pressure.  Reports of Red Panda poaching and smuggling seem to be increasing, perhaps through demand in China. F. Momberg (pers. comm. 2010) saw Red Panda carcases and skins in villagers' homes in eastern Myanmar. One hunter allowed him to accompany him while he caught a Red Panda with his hands; apparently these villagers regularly take Red Pandas. Wildlife trade is rampant in Myanmar (about 30 tons of wildlife products per month), facilitated by wildlife habitat proximity to the Chinese border. Before Red Panda was upgraded to Appendix I of CITES in the early 1990s, individuals captured in Myanmar were traded by China to zoos around the world.   Ang Phuri Sherpa (pers. comm. 2015)  reported an increase in illegal trade over the preceding three years, based on the number of poachers and traders caught in Nepal. These incidents mostly involved skins and the items were headed for China. One incident involved a live Red Panda. A general increase in interest in Red Panda skins and meat in China could fuel more trade. A US businessman reported Red Pandas on offer in a restaurant. In the 'Threats' discussions during the 2012 Red Panda PHVA in China, many Chinese participants indicated that Red Panda meat was fairly widely available in restaurants, although no details are available.    The live Red Panda trade, for pets, also seems to be increasing. Ian Lee (Chinese representative for Red Panda Network, pers. comm. 2015) found several reports in Chinese newspapers and social media of Red Pandas for sale as pets. This corroborates indications that Red Panda is increasing in popularity as a pet in China and other Asian countries, notably Thailand (YouTube videos and Instagram photos).  Ngwe Lwin (pers. comm. 2014) considers hunting and poaching the major threat to the Red Panda in Myanmar, in two ways: in one area, Red Panda is not a target species but is caught in iron traps, and some of skins are traded; in another, live Red Pandas are traded to China, motivating local people to go to catch them whenever they have time.

The population in Magombera, in Kilombera Valley, was severely affected by the construction of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway (in 1972–1975) which bisected Magombera Forest, and through selective logging and agricultural expansion. The presence of the railway facilitated agricultural encroachment into the reserve, and increased the number of bush fires. Agriculture was responsible for a decline in the reserve’s size from 15 km² in 1955 to less than 11 km² by 1979. The area was threatened with total destruction in 2002 when the Government of Tanzania agreed to relocate squatters there from the nearby Kilombero Sugar Estate. Fortunately, the international conservation community appealed to the Government of Tanzania, which averted destruction of the forest, which contains >1,000 red colobus (Struhsaker 2005).  The local Wahehe people hunt P. gordonorum, particularly in the western and south-western parts of the range (Struhsaker et al. 2013).

In Bhutan, although some parts of the range are in reasonable condition, in other areas, its habitat is being destroyed by overgrazing by livestock, and in the area previously in Doga National Park, by grass burning during the dry season (Blower, 1985a).  In India, within protected areas, the status of goral populations is probably satisfactory. Nevertheless, they are often hunted for meat even within many of the protected areas. The most significant threat to them is severe habitat disturbance and alteration, particularly in the lower portions of the Himalayas and in northeastern India. However, limited disturbance and habitat alteration that creates or maintains some shrub and forest cover, may not be greatly detrimental to the survival of goral populations.

Except with the aid of dogs, long-beaked echidnas are extremely  difficult to locate as they occur at naturally low densities and are  nocturnal. Local hunters in the YUS Conservation Area on the Huon Peninsula report  that the meat of Z. bartoni is highly prized, and that it tastes like pork. Local  people also report that the species remains common above 3000 m, in  areas that are remote from villages and which experience low hunting  pressure because they are seldom visited (Gabriel Porolak, unpubl. obs. 2014). A hunting study in the area conducted between 2012 and 2014 recorded only two Z. bartoni  kills, one at 2200 m and the other at 3200 m. This low kill rate is  probably a reflection of depletion of populations in areas accessible to  hunters, and persistence only in less accessible areas (G. Porolak unpubl.).Habitat degradation and conversion may be significant,  but given the ecological breadth displayed by long-beaked echidnas, habitat changes are unlikely to be important as primary threats.  However, they probably increase the likelihood of detection and  predation, and there is a clear correlation between habitat conversion  or degradation and regional extinction of other species of Zaglossus.

Oil palm plantations are likely to expand in the future as a result of the push for biofuels, and forest cover on the island of Borneo, if current deforestation rates continue, is projected to decline from 50% to less than one-third by 2020 (Rautner 2005). A more recent analysis of deforestation risk predicts that by 2020 37% of the remaining forest in Borneo will have a greater than 25% risk of being deforested and that approximately 13% of Borneo’s forests (an area of 11,167 km²) will have a greater than 50% chance of being lost (Macdonald et al. in prep. a). This deforestation will not only reduce the area of available habitat for the Sunda Clouded Leopard but it is also likely to increase the fragmentation of its populations. In a modelling analysis of the likely impacts of this deforestation, Macdonald et al. (in prep. b) predict that between 2010 and 2020 the percentage of the landscape connected by dispersal in Borneo will decrease by over 60% and that this could lead to both a large reduction in the Sunda Clouded Leopard numbers and also a significant reduction in the potential gene flow between populations. Increased fragmentation of Clouded Leopard habitat may also be resulting in an increased risk of disease in some populations due to exposure to pathogens present in feral cat and dog populations. One study in Sabah found seropositive findings for canine parvovirus and/or distemper virus in feral cats and dogs, Malay Civets (Viverra tangalunga) and Common Palm Civets (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus) living sympatrically with Sunda Clouded Leopards (Nájera et al. in prep).Poaching, either directly through the use of snares, or through the reduction of prey availability by the poaching of game species, poses a significant threat, both in Sumatra (Holden et al. 2001) and Borneo (Rabinowitz et al. 1987, Wilting et al. 2006, Cheyne et al. 2013).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

These nets, which are used by poachers, have become increasingly cheap and widely available in recent years: one study recorded 50 'outlets' freely selling these nets on the Moscow-Vladimir section of the Nizhny Novgorod highway alone (http://www.biodiversity.ru/eng/programs/desman/results.html). The very low price and high durability of modern nets means that poachers often leave them in the water for days or even months, checking them only occasionally and often abandoning them. A Desman dies on average within 5-10 minutes when trapped in a net. The second most important threat is the use of 'electric landing nets' (or electric rods), which use an electric current to stun fish. These items of equipment, also used by poachers, have become widespread over the last 10-15 years. They are not believed to directly harm Desmans, as a general rule, but they almost totally wipe out the fish and aquatic invertebrates that the Desman depends upon.  A third major threat is habitat loss and degradation. During the second half of the twentieth century water pollution, creation of impoundments, drainage, clearance of riparian vegetation, and uncontrolled agricultural exploitation of flood plains became widespread and contributed to the decline in the species' population. However, this process has abated somewhat in the last decade, and its influence on the decline in the Russian Desman population is today secondary. Competition for breeding sites with introduced Nutria (Myocastor coypus) and Muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) may also be a threat.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

In the former Transvaal Province (South Africa), this species was given the highest regional priority score for mammals (Freitag and van Jaarsveld 1997). The type population on Bronberg Ridge (Gauteng) is severely impacted by degradation, fragmentation and loss of its natural soil habitat owing to intensive urbanization and an expanding quartzite mining operation within its highly restricted range (hence this subpopulation is also assessed separately). While the other two subpopulations (Modimolle district and southwestern Kruger National Park) occur within protected areas, there are no intermediate distribution records suggesting gene flow between them. Agricultural practices on farms surrounding the subpopulation from the vicinity of Nylsvley Provincial Nature Reserve are altering and degrading patches of suitable habitats on farms (Jackson et al. 2007a, 2007b), and could be reducing numbers at some locations of the Modimolle subpopulation. Roads infrastructure in Kruger National Park (soil compaction) may create barriers for golden mole movement. The direct and indirect impacts of various land uses on the species and its natural habitat may be poorly understood, but the effects of habitat fragmentation (especially in range-restricted taxa) causing obstructions to animal movement (≈ gene flow), increased inbreeding potential, reduced genetic variability and an increased risk of extinction.The species’ elusive habits often obscure signs of its presence. Developers committed to follow recommendations of Environmental Management Plans (EMP) and Requirements of Development (RoD) are reliant on golden mole specialists for guidance in respect of minimizing impacts on the species. If genetic clarification reveal that two taxa exist within the current extent of occurrence (see Taxonomic Note), adequate measures to protect the reduced distributional ranges of each taxon would be all the more important.Inferred minor threats are predation by domestic pets, persecution by gardeners and land owners.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The forests of Viet Nam are subject to very high levels of indiscriminate hunting especially snaring for small game such as chevrotains and civets (Timmins and Duckworth 2000; Timmins et al. 2007; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008) and specifically this is so around Buon Luoi (Kuznetzov and Borissenko 2004). In general, hunting pressure may be somewhat lower in southern regions of the country although this region is less well known when compared with the northern Annamites and the northern parts of the Central Annamites (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Whether this species would be able to cope with high hunting levels is not yet debatable as there are no relevant data, but some congeners persist in the face of very heavy hunting, even in fragmented and degraded landscapes (see 2008 IUCN Red List accounts of other Tragulus). Declines in T. versicolor are very likely to have happened to some extent, because even the most resilient ground-dwelling species in chevrotain size-class occur in unnaturally low densities in most forest areas of Viet Nam (Timmins et al. 1999; Timmins and Trinh Viet Cuong 2001; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Spotlight surveys in protected areas around Buon Luoi totalling 100 hours in about year 2003 found no chevrotains (Kuznetzov and Borissenko 2004), but the significance of this is unclear, as chevrotains are absent or exceptionally rare in various Lao forests whence they cannot plausibly have been eradicated, given their persistence in other more heavily hunted and degraded areas (see 2008 account for T. kanchil). Hunting patterns are similar in Lao PDR and Cambodia, which may also be found to support the species, although the intensity and severity of hunting is generally less than in Viet Nam, but on the increase (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008).Habitat degradation and fragmentation may also be threats, depending on how well the species persists in such areas. These processes occur widely in the species' known range and throughout its plausible range. Habitat conversion is more likely to reduce or eliminate populations where it occurs, although there is no evidence of whether T. versicolor can use plantation crop landscapes. By the mid 1990s the area around Buon Luoi had been completely deforested and converted to agriculture (Kuznetzov and Borissenko 2004). Although protected areas remain in the general region, all are being logged and heavily hunted (Kuznetzov and Borissenko 2004).

Although the lack of information, especially outside Europe, prevents us from drawing a general conclusion, hybridization is considered widespread; there may be very few Wild Cat populations remaining where there is little history of hybridization with the domestic cat (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Macdonald et al. 2004, Phelan and Sliwa 2006, Driscoll et al. 2007). Feral domestic cats also compete with Wild Cats for prey and space, and there is a high potential for disease transmission between domestic cats and Wild Cats (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Yamaguchi et al. 1996, Daniels et al. 1999, Macdonald et al. 2004).   Other threats include significant human-caused mortality, in Europe, especially road kills (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Lüps et al. 2002, Schulenberg 2005). The species is still considered a pest in Scotland and is illegally persecuted (Macdonald et al. 2004). Predator control measures in a number of European countries may result in this species being killed as bycatch, e.g. snaring and lamping in Scotland. Wild Cats are also killed as pests in southern Africa, although this does not seem to have resulted in population declines (Stuart et al. 2013). In the past Asian Wild Cats were trapped in large numbers for their fur, although at present there is little international trade (Nowell and Jackson 1996).   Historically, habitat loss led to dramatic declines in Europe and Russia in the 18th to mid-20th centuries (Macdonald et al. 2004).

Feral dogs are known predators of this species.In western Madagascar, Zinner et al. (2014) showed that for central Menabe, one of the most important centres of distribution of Bokiboky, deforestation rates of 0.78 km²/yr during 2003-2006 increased to 1.09 km²/yr in 2006-2008, and to 2.55 km²/yr by 2008-2010. There is ample evidence that the recent trend has continued in 2010-2104, with in addition increased illegal logging and hunting in the core forest areas, which will undoubtedly negatively impact populations of all native carnivores, especially through the increased presence of dogs.  The recently rediscovered southern population of M. d. lineata in the Mikea forests has an extremely low population density (Goodman et al. 2005).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

As with most forest-dwelling animals in Madagascar, deforestation to cultivated land, hunting and negative effect of introduced carnivores are the most important threats. Deforestation and forest disturbance across its range has increased significantly since 2009. R. Rajaonson (pers. comm. 2014) estimates that deforestation in eastern forest increased from 0.5% per annum in 2005-2010 to 0.94% per annum in 2010-2013. Allnut et al. (2009) estimated that in Masoala National Park, annual rates of deforestation in the studied area increased to 1.27% per annum in 2011. High levels of illegal settlement in protected areas, especially around the Bay of Antongil, are linked to artisanal mining (for quartz) and logging of rosewood, and hunting for food using dogs has increased greatly in these areas as a result. Some villages have seen increases in populations of between 200 and 300% (C. Golden pers. comm. 2014).This species is persecuted for raiding local poultry (Golden 2005) and is killed by dogs accompanying hunters in the forest. Hunting and/or bushmeat consumption presents a serious concern for Ring-tailed Vontsira across the eastern rainforest. Golden et al. (in press) reported 21 Ring-tailed Vontsiras hunted in one year at Betampona Strict Nature Reserve. In the Makira landscape a total of 169 Ring-tailed Vontsiras were consumed within four villages (144 households) from 2005 to 2011 near the Makira Natural Park. Hunting rates were positively associated with Ring-tailed Vontsira occupancy, meaning hunters appear to be focusing their efforts in non-degraded forest where it is most abundant. In addition, Ring-tailed Vontsira consistently was the most purchased and most trapped small carnivore across the landscape, which is likely to reflect its overall apparent abundance and higher level of activity in and around anthropogenic areas (Farris et al. in review a).Household interviews conducted by Madagasikara Voakajy (pers. comm. 2014) in the Moramanga region of eastern Madagascar in 2008-2009 suggested that 385 (24%) of 1,631 respondents interviewed in 129 villages had eaten Ring-tailed Vontsira in the preceding year. Certain parts of the animal (e.g. the tail) are used for cultural purposes by some tribal groups (Goodman 2003). Competition with the introduced Small Indian Civet Viverricula indica and feral cats and dogs may threaten this species in parts of its range. Ring-tailed Vontsira had very strong temporal activity overlap with dogs and moderate overlap with feral/wild cats, revealing the potential for increased interactions and competition (Farris et al. in review b). Co-occurrence models demonstrate that the Vontsira does not occur at sites where Small Indian Civet activity is very high, and that Vontsira probability of occupancy is greatly decreased in the presence of Small Indian Civets (Farris et al. in review c).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Not only did numbers of bats decline, but number of caves used as maternity roosts also declined by nearly 50% (from 15 to 18) in Florida over the same period. There is no indication that the population has stabilized. Some caves occupied in the early 1980s are no longer occupied (Gore and Hovis 1992). However, Brown (1997) reported that this species is adaptable and seems to be holding its own in the southeastern United States. While the Florida population was thriving in the 1960s, Barbour and Davis (1969) reported that the Ohio River Valley population was steadily declining and apparently nearing extirpation. Current data from this northern range indicates that populations are still present in low numbers, although their status remains largely unknown. Indiana populations had declined considerably by 1980 (Mumford and Whitaker 1982), although populations were always small. Recent extensive searches in Illinois indicated that the population has become more restricted than in the past; only one hibernating colony was located, compared to nine previously known hibernating sites, and the bats were only found in four counties compared to six in the past. Georgia has 12 older records (before 1970), and only one record since 1970, but this change could be due to lack of searching. Recent field studies in coastal North Carolina, South Carolina, and eastern Texas have located populations of this species, but there are no baseline data with which to compare trends. Declines likely have resulted from various factors, especially human disturbance and physical alteration of caves used as hibernacula and maternity sites (Gore and Hovis 1992). Excessive human visitation may awaken bats and cause them to use up fat reserves. In maternity colonies, disturbance may cause females to abandon their young. Heavy collecting or banding may cause a population to vacate a site. Attempts to collect, even in winter, usually result in bats vacating at least temporarily (Mumford and Whitaker 1982). In addition, some caves have been made unavailable or degraded by the closing off of their entrances, installation of bat-impermeable barriers, forest removal around entrances, or by flooding by reservoirs. Loss of upland roosts increases vulnerability to mortality from sudden flooding. One cave formerly used by 11,000 individuals was turned into a public dump and virtually abandoned by bats. Clearing and draining of bottonland hardwood forest wetlands likely have reduced available habitat for summer roosting and foraging. The indirect effects of pesticide use are unknown.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

This trade value pre-dates the meteoric rise in volume and financial value of wildlife trade out of Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia during the 1990s and 2000s. Salter et al. (1990) found three sets of male and two sets of female Kouprey horns (all reportedly from Cambodia) in a village in southern Champasak Province (southern Lao PDR). The male horns were valued by the owner at USD 4,000 and the female horns at USD 1,600 per set. During a trip to Amphoe Muang (Mukdahan Province, Thailand, on the border with Lao) on 29 March 1991, Kouprey parts were found to be available at one vendor. Horns were not on display but customers could examine photographs in an album: female Kouprey horns were offered at USD 6,000-8,000 per pair and male horns at USD 2,000 per pair. The male horns were polished so that the shredded ends could not be seen. During a second visit (in July 1991) the same vendor's stall was less active and no Kouprey trophies were on offer (although Gaur and Banteng could still be ordered). Wild cattle trophies were on offer at other vendors but no Kouprey horns or skulls were for sale at these stalls (Srikosamatara et al. 1992). During a visit to Ban Mai (Thai/Lao border) by Srikosamatara and his colleagues in April 1993 a vendor of wildlife products claimed to have sold a pair of Kouprey horns to a Thai buyer for USD 800 two years before. He also claimed to have two more sets of Kouprey horns (both old males) for sale at USD 2,800 and USD 12,000 respectively. Three months later (July 1993) another survey (by I. Baird) found no Kouprey trophies for sale at the same vendors (Srikosamatara and Suteethorn 1994). Bounties for Kouprey trophy horns were still believed to circulate in SE Asia as of 2010 (AWCSG 2011).Diseases from domestic and/or free-ranging livestock could have disastrous consequences given the already severely reduced Kouprey population. Habitat loss as a result of the rapidly increasing land clearance for cultivation (local and commercial), mining and logging, as well as increasing levels of other human disturbances, are also threats, but are insignificant compared with hunting (Tordoff et al. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, see also 2008 account for Banteng). Many wildlife species of high monetary value still remain widespread and, relative to neighbouring countries, abundant in the extensive lowland forests of Cambodia, and with the fall of the Khmer Rouge and a rapidly growing free market economy there has been a surge of hunting to supply bushmeat, trophy antler/horn and medicinal markets, which is leading in many cases to very rapid declines in large quarry species (e.g. macaques have declined in some areas by over 90% in as little as five years; Timmins 2006, Bezuijen et al. 2008, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), thus, however, rare Kouprey becomes it will continually be at risk because, unlike in a single-quarry species system where at certain levels it becomes uneconomic to seek out the last few individuals, hunting levels will remain high, fuelled by returns from the more common species (Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Timmins and Ou 2001, Tordoff et al. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Wild Oxen in Cambodia are now low in number and in most areas now rare or already hunted out (see IUCN Red List accounts for Banteng, Gaur and Wild Water Buffalo). Knowledge of the Kouprey is widespread among rural people in Cambodia, concerning its rarity and the value of trophies and perhaps other body parts; as such it is a more desirable target than most in Cambodia.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

It now survives mainly in and around protected areas and in other areas with low densities of people and livestock. Its persistence in West Africa is probably due to its ability to withstand illegal hunting pressures better than many other large herbivores, especially the more water dependant and more sedentary species which are more exposed to poaching (East 1999, Chardonnet and Crosmary 2013).Different explanations have been provided for the decline of Roan and its lack of subsequent recovery in the Kruger N.P. in South Africa, 450 animals in 1986 to around 30 in 2001 (Harrington et al. 1999, Grant et al. 2002). The most likely reason is increased predation pressure by Lions, following the influx of grazers following construction of artificial waterpoints (Knoop and Owen-Smith 2006). Illegal hunting probably contributed to the decline of the Roan Antelope in Masai Mara N.R. in Kenya in the 1970s (Hofer et al. 1996).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Poaching and armed conflict have been a major threat, specially for the Giant Sable and Sable populations in Mozambique. Further decline in the distribution and numbers of the Sable Antelope may occur in the more northerly parts of its range in future, unless the expansion of human populations and livestock is countered by the implementation of higher levels of protection and management of wildlife in countries such as Tanzania, Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique (East 1999).A former stronghold of Sable in N Botswana, near the Caprivi border, has been severely impacted by the construction of the Northern Buffalo Fence, which has affected their access to water, causing significant mortality (Estes 2013). Inbreeding, evidenced by increased calf mortality, is a major risk in many of the smaller, privately owned herds of Sable (Grobler and Van der Bank 1994). The survival of the Giant Sable through the Angolan civil war (1975-2002) is highly encouraging, but its survival remains precarious as many Angolans who fled the Luando Reserve during the mid-1970s flood back to areas they had formerly evacuated. There have been recent incidents of hybridization of Giant Sable with Roan Antelope in the Cangandala NP (Vaz Pinto 2006, Vaz Pinto et al. 2016).",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

It is therefore susceptible to single threatening processes, like cyclones, that could simultaneously or rapidly affect its entire range.The major threat to the species within this range appears to be disturbance at roost sites. The bats appear highly susceptible to human disturbance, and infrequent hunting and rock falls in unstable lava tubes have been recorded at roost sites (Middleton 1998, 1999; Sewall et al. 2003). Additionally, cave surveys between 2000-2005 revealed the bats were absent from three caves where they apparently formerly occurred (Sewall et al. 2003, W. Masefield, pers. comm.), though it is unclear whether this suggests intermittent use of some roost sites or abandonment after disturbance.Over the last few decades, the Comoros have undergone a sustained, rapid deforestation, resulting in the loss of nearly all its native forests. During the past 20 years alone, the country has lost 75% of its remaining forests, the fastest rate of any country in the world (UNDP 2013). Human pressures on native forests are expected to continue, as the growth rate of the human population remains high at 2.5% (UNDP 2013). Because R. obliviosus is regularly recorded in human-modified landscapes, loss of foraging habitat via deforestation is possibly not a major threat (Bergmans 1994). However, even human-modified landscapes containing non-native and remnant native trees are disappearing in the Comoros to make room for ground crops (FAO 2010, BJS pers. obs.); thus food resources for this species have probably been declining in recent years. Further, the loss of natural and underplanted forests may reduce its ability to cope with droughts and cyclones, and may limit its access to food resources when fruit from horticultural species is unavailable (Sewall et al. 2003). In addition, the replacement of native forests with agricultural land on Anjouan and Mohéli may render formerly inaccessible roost sites on Anjouan and Mohéli more easily reached, possibly exposing roosts to increased levels of human disturbance. Finally, the loss of native forests has resulted in impermanence or complete drying of nearly all rivers on Anjouan and most on Mohéli (Louette et al. 2004). R. obliviosus roosts on those islands are typically near waterfalls, and it is unclear whether that is simply where suitable caves and rock shelters occur or if the bats benefit from the adjacent water source. The species could benefit from an adjacent water source if, for instance, local humidity reduces evaporative water loss in the normally hot climate of the Comoros. If so, then it is possible the seasonal or year-round loss of water flow could affect this species on Anjouan and Mohéli as well.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In Italy, subspecies ornata might be vulnerable to many factors because the total number is small, there are only three subpopulations, and genetic variability is very low (Shackleton 1997, S. Lovari pers. comm. 2006). Space and food competition with livestock, especially domestic caprins, seem to be the main limiting factors for ornata . Some poaching occurs, but does not seem to impair the viability of the chamois population in Abruzzo National Park. There are currently no problems with disease for the Italian subspecies (J. Herrero pers. comm. 2006). However, in France and Spain disease is currently the most important threat. Pestivirus appeared in the Pyrenean subspecies in c. 2004, and sarcoptic mange outbreaks periodically cause local declines in the Cantabrian subspecies (J. Herrero pers. comm. 2006). In Spain and the Pyrenees, chamois coexist with domestic livestock, but there do not appear to be problems with competition; indeed in the Pyrenees the presence of domestic livestock is considered to benefit the chamois, via maintenance of young and good quality forage, which increases the carrying capacity (J. Berducou pers. comm. 2006). Most Pyrenean and Cantabrian populations are hunted (with the exception of within National Parks). Chamois is a major game species in Spain and is important socially and economically as a source of rural livelihoods. Hunting is carefully managed and revenue from hunting is returned to the local community. In Spain, regional governments set quotas, and hunting is not at an unsustainable level (J. Herrero pers. comm. 2006). In France, hunting is essentially a recreational and non-profit leisure activity, and average annual quotas are under 10% of censused populations. This is sustainable, with only a few local exceptions (C. Berducou pers. comm. 2006).",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Many of the kaya (sacred) forests have been severely degraded by tree felling and pole collecting, and their boundaries eroded by agricultural encroachment and fire. Habitat loss not only results in a reduced distribution, but also increases isolation of the remaining small populations. Within Arabuko-Sokoke Forest, the species appears to be adversely affected by logging (but not pole collecting), primarily in the Cynometra habitat type. This may be due to the resulting reduction in leaf litter and canopy cover, and the loss of hollow trunks used as refuges (FitzGibbon 1994, Bauer 1996, Rathbun and Kyalo 2000, Ngaruiya 2009); trapping by woodcarvers who camp in the Cynometra habitat for long periods and trap a variety of wildlife for food may also be contributing to the decline. It was estimated in the early 1990s that about 3,000 Golden-rumped Sengis were being caught per year by hunters in Arabuko-Sokoke Forest. At that time the species was not being targeted by hunters (it has an unpleasant taste, is not attracted to bait and does not make obvious trails along which traps could be set), it was primarily caught in traps and snares designed for other animals (particularly the Four-toed Sengi, Petrodromus tetradactylus), and overall trapping was considered unlikely to be having a significant impact on population levels (FitzGibbon et al. 1995). Although trapping intensity in Arabuko-Sokoke was being reduced by forest guard patrols in the 1990s, unrestricted trapping in un-patrolled areas may have had a negative impact in those large areas. It is not known what protection measures are currently in effect. Predation by dogs may be an additional threat close to areas of habitation (FitzGibbon 1994).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Given the life history similarities between the Golden-rumped Sengi and the Black and Rufous Sengi (Rathbun 1979), it is very likely that the latter is experiencing overall population declines due to habitat loss and degradation (Hanna and Anderson 1994).

The extent of occurrence of Tehuantepec Jackrabbits is  jeopardized by habitat alteration and degradation by introduction of  exotic grasses, human-induced fires, agriculture, cattle-raising  activities, and human settlements in savannas. These activities have  resulted in fragmentation of the habitat of the Tehuantepec Jackrabbit,  so that their existing populations are almost completely isolated, and  most possess low genetic viability (Flux and Angermann 1990, Rico et al.  2008). Land use changes for activities such as livestock production and  agriculture, as well as the expansion of human settlements, are already  reducing the natural vegetation (savannas) of the Tehuantepec  Jackrabbit at a rate of 1.2% per year over a period of 26 years  (1986-2012) with a total loss of 6,850.6 ha (Sántiz et al. 2016).  Human-induced fires in the savanna accounted for 20% of adult deaths.  Historically, excessive hunting is another anthropogenic factor that  caused the decrease of population densities of this species,  contributing to its current situation (Lorenzo et al. 2008, 2017,  2018). In addition, the species is shot by numerous parties of hunters  coming from cities up to 200 km away to shoot deer by spotlighting at  night. Poaching accounted for 13% of adult deaths, and for 6% of  juvenile deaths.Possible species competing for food (Eastern  Cottontail and cattle) and predators (Coyotes and foxes) of Tehuantepec  Jackrabbits may be affecting their populations. Direct observations in  Santa María del Mar point to domestic dogs (Canis familiaris), Rat  Snakes (Masticophis mentovarius), and Deaf Snakes (Trimorphodon  biscutatus) as the main predators of the Tehuantepec Jackrabbit (Rioja et al.  2011). Predation was the major cause of mortality for radio-marked  jackrabbits and accounted for 94% of juvenile deaths and 67% of adult  deaths during a 29 month study. In San Francisco del Mar Pueblo Viejo  and Aguachil, cattle and horses can act as potential competitors of food  and transmitters of diseases of the Tehuantepec Jackrabbit (Rioja  2008).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Genetic variability in ibex populations is among the lowest reported from microsatellites in mammal species, and the Alpi Marittime–Mercantour population in particular has suffered from a severe genetic bottleneck associated with its reintroduction (Maudet et al. 2002). The ibex's distribution remains fragmented and many colonies are small and thus vulnerable to epizootics and stochastic events as well as inbreeding depression. Colonies with >60 individuals are believed to be viable as long as diseases (most importantly mange) do not affect them (Shackleton 1997, EMA Workshop 2006). Hybridization can be a threat where populations are small and sympatric with high densities of domestic goats, as is the case in Italy (Randi et al. 1990, Pedrotti and Lovari 1999). High densities of domestic goats and sheep may also have a negative impact on the ibex through parasite and disease transmission and resource competition (Shackleton 1997, J. Herrero pers. comm. 2006). Appropriate habitat for the species may be decreasing, as the abandonment of traditional agriculture means that high-altitude alpine meadows are reverting to forest through natural succession (EMA Workshop 2006). Human disturbance as a result of increased tourism and recreation is suspected to be a general threat to mountain ungulates (Shackleton 1997). Alpine ibex are legally hunted in some areas (e.g. Bulgaria, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia), although hunting is completely prohibited in several range states (Shackleton 1997). Legal hunting is not considered a threat if it is properly planned and regulated, but poaching is a potential threat (Dupré et al. 2001).",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Human population growth in the range states continues at roughly 2.7% annually and will not slow down for several decades (United Nations 2015, WorldPop 2016). Road access into once-remote forests – even around protected areas – has hugely increased over the last 20–30 years (Laporte et al. 2007), facilitating hunting and transportation of bushmeat to both local markets and distant urban centres (Abernethy et al. 2013, Ziegler et al. 2016).Although this taxon may be the most resistant of the arboreal monkeys to hunting pressure, it is less tolerant to forest disturbance (Oates 2011, Gautier-Hion 2013). In West Africa, and in much of Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, the species is subject to habitat modification, as intact forest is converted to farmland and “farm bush” which can be seen clearly in Tyukavina et al. (2016). In the Cameroon (SE), CAR, DRC, Congo and Gabon portions of this taxon’s range, forest loss is relatively low (Hansen et al. 2013), due to historically lower human population densities and selective logging, as opposed to clear-cutting, practised in the region. However, forest loss in the most recent year available (2014) was higher than in all previous years (from 2001) in Cameroon, Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, DRC and Equatorial Guinea, and in Gabon, Guinea and Liberia this was true for 2013, followed by 2014 (World Resources Institute 2016). Deforestation will greatly increase in the future as industrial agriculture starts to expand, removing forests suitable for various forest-obligate species (Wich et al. 2014).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Hunting is implicated in apparent large-scale changes in the dry season distribution of Black Lechwe, with a dramatic decrease in the numbers occupying the western end of the main Bangweulu Swamps where poaching is intense. In contrast, its numbers appeared to be stable or increasing in the central section of the main swamp, and there was a steady increase in the dry season population on the 100 km² Chimbwi Plain in south-eastern Bangweulu (East 1999). Commercial hunting was also the primary reason for the dramatic decline in numbers of the Upemba Lechwe (Cotterill 2005).Droughts and disruption of the natural flooding regime are significant causes of population decline. For example, water flow on the Kafue floodplain has been regulated almost entirely by human needs since the construction of hydroelectric dams at the eastern and western ends of the Flats in the 1970s.

In Korup National Park, P. preussi made up a relatively large proportion of the total primate offtake (22% of carcasses) in a recent study (Linder and Oates 2011). Hunting sign encounter rate has increased through time in southern Korup NP from 0.28 signs/km (86 signs along 196.5 km walked) in 2001–2002 (D. Okon pers. comm. 2015) to 0.41 signs/km (155 signs along 382.2 km walked) in 2013–2015 (Linder et al. 2015). Between 2013 and 2014, nearly 300 P. preussi were killed by 30 surveyed hunters living within 3 km of Korup (Astaras and Linder 2016). Offtake surveys of hunters in a village in northeast Korup NP indicated that Preuss’s red colobus represented 2.4% of the 824 animals killed by hunters in June 2016 (Hofner 2016). Fa et al. (2006) counted 494 Preuss’s Red Colobus carcasses for sale in rural Cameroonian bushmeat markets and 284 Preuss’s Red Colobus in rural Nigerian bushmeat markets between August 2002 and January 2003. Most of these red colobus carcasses were recorded in markets close to Korup NP. In addition to the threat from hunting, red colobus habitats have suffered and continue to suffer from forest loss and declining habitat quality, driven primarily by logging and small- and large-scale agriculture (Waltert et al. 2002, Forboseh et al. 2007, Linder 2013, Schoneveld 2014, B. Morgan pers. obs. 2016), resulting in a 3.8% decrease in tree cover since 2000 (Global Forest Watch 2019). Forests directly to the north and east of Korup NP have been and continue to be selectively logged, as have forests in the Makombe-Ndokbou area. One of the most exploited timber species in southwestern Cameroon is Lophira alata (Namuene 2014), a tree species that red colobus monkeys rely on for food. Large-scale industrial oil-palm plantations located adjacent to Korup NP and Ebo Forest threaten the integrity of forests in both areas. Underlying these threats is an increasing human population, leading to increasing demands for bushmeat and other natural resources. The human population growth rate in Cameroon and Nigeria is high and has been increasing from ~2.0% annual growth rate in the early 1960s to 2.6% in 2017–2018 (World Bank 2019).  The so-called “Anglophone Crisis” in the South West and North West Regions of Cameroon further exacerbates the threats listed above. Since 2017, conservation activities in Korup NP (SW Region) have been suspended due to civil unrest, which has forced a substantial proportion of the human population to flee into the forest. This has likely led to increased pressure on forest resources in and around Korup NP, including increased hunting of red colobus monkeys.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

As has occurred historically, exploitation for nutritional, medicinal and spiritualistic purposes takes place locally (Anon 1999, Nash et al. 2016, Trageser et al. 2017, D'Cruze et al. 2018). However, evidence suggests that local use is now frequently forgone in favour of entering animals into national and international trade given their high financial value (Newton et al. 2008, Thapa 2013, MacMillan and Nguyen 2014). International use involves trafficking of the species and its derivatives despite the species being included in Appendix I of CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Challender et al. (2015) estimated that between 2000 and 2013 international trafficking in this species potentially involved ~50,000 individuals, though the actual number between 2000 and 2018 is higher (see Challender et al. 2019). In China and Viet Nam, the meat is consumed conspicuously as a luxury wild meat for which affluent consumers are willing to pay high prices (Shairp et al. 2016). This species also appears in both Chinese and Vietnamese traditional medicinal literature which prescribes the use of scales in traditional medicines to treat skin conditions, improve blood circulation and to stimulate milk secretion in lactating women (e.g., Chinese Pharmacopeia Commission, 2015). In China, pangolin scales also appear to be prescribed for these and other ailments, and cancer (Yu and Hong 2018), through designated outlets such as hospitals, but also through traditional medicine retailers. Since 2009 the Chinese government has released an average of 26.6 tonnes of pangolin scales from (presumably) government stockpiles on to a legal market for scales in the county (CBCGDF 2016), and which are certified through a certification system. However, this mechanism is undermined by ongoing illegal trade and availability of scales in traditional medicines shops in China (Xu et al. 2016). Ongoing but illicit availability is also the case in Viet Nam (Challender et al. 2015).Other threats include infrastructure development, habitat loss and fragmentation, and pesticide use. In China, major developments including hydropower stations and mining also pose a threat.Taiwan and Hong Kong are exceptions where populations are not threatened by heavy hunting or poaching. The threats here include predation by feral dogs, roadkill and development, i.e. conversion of land for human use. In Taiwan, research suggests that Chinese Pangolins can become trapped in burrows or tree hollows, and is a cause of mortality, as is their capture in gin traps (Sun et al. 2019).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The South African National Land-Cover change report found a 32.8% decline in natural wetlands nationally from 1990– 2013/14, which is a combination of both genuine wetland loss through anthropogenic activities and the generally drier conditions currently that in 1990 (GeoTerraImage 2015). In the Western Cape specifically, 31% of all wetlands (plus a 32 m buffer) and riparian areas have been transformed or lost to agricultural land use (Pence 2012). Habitat loss due to land transformation in the surrounding matrix further isolates wetlands from one another and exacerbates the degradation of individual wetlands. For example, sugarcane and forestry plantations are often planted right up to wetlands edges, not respecting the appropriate buffer. In KwaZulu-Natal alone, there an average loss of natural habitat of 1.2% per annum between in 1994 and 2011 from agriculture, plantations, built environments and settlements, mines and dams (Jewitt et al. 2015). Although no specific rates of habitat loss are available, 61% of Mpumalanga’s land surface between 2000 and 2014 have come under pressure from prospecting applications (Lötter 2015). In Mpumalanga, only 51% of the grasslands are still natural and not previously ploughed and 40% of the grassland vegetation types are listed as threatened (Lötter et al. 2014). Water abstraction or filling in of wetlands from human settlement and industrial expansion also leads to habitat loss. Similarly, suppression of natural ecosystem processes, such as fire, can also lead to habitat degradation through bush encroachment or loss of plant diversity through alien invasive species, and is suspected to be increasing with human settlement expansion. Overall, 45% of our remaining wetland area exists in a heavily modified condition, due primarily to onsite modification from crop cultivation, coal mining, urban development, dam construction, and overgrazing (and thus erosion) and off-site modifications from disruptions to flow regime and deterioration of water quality (Driver et al. 2012).Overgrazing the vegetation around wetlands reduces ground cover and thus leads to decreased small mammal diversity and abundance (Bowland and Perrin 1989, 1993).The expansion of wildlife ranching will have to be monitored in this regard, as game overstocking may also affect wetland condition.Climate change is projected to reduce area of occupancy significantly by reducing temperate grasslands and fynbos habitats. For example, climate models for the similarly mesic-adapted species, O. irroratus, show a decline in area of occupancy of 12–24% by 2050 (Taylor et al. 2016). Overgrazing and climate change may synergise to cause non-linear and accelerating population decline. More research is needed to validate these hypotheses.  ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

The major threats to Pan troglodytes are:1. PoachingDespite the fact that all killing, capture or consumption of great apes is illegal, poaching is the greatest threat to most Chimpanzees. Due to their low population densities and slow reproductive rates, hunting often leads to the local extirpation of Chimpanzee populations. Increases in human populations, the ease of obtaining guns and ammunition, transport system efficiency, and high financial incentives for supplying urban markets with bushmeat and other forest commodities have resulted in swathes of land in the forest zone of Africa being cleared of wildlife. Chimpanzees are generally hunted opportunistically, but are sometimes targeted because they provide more meat than smaller mammals, such as duikers. Throughout the African moist forest region, poaching is intense around resources extraction camps – especially industrial and artisanal mining sites and logging camps – where bushmeat is usually the main source of protein available. Hunting with guns (targeting individuals) and snaring (an indiscriminate method of trapping) are the most common ways that Chimpanzees are killed. The widespread use of wire snares across Africa means that Chimpanzees can be caught and killed (or maimed) in snares set for other terrestrial mammals (e.g., Quiatt et al. 2002).When Chimpanzees are killed for meat, their infants sometimes become pets, and some are trafficked (e.g., Hicks et al. 2010). Although all trade in Chimpanzees and their body parts is illegal, a small but pernicious and clandestine trade persists is some parts of Africa (e.g., CITES Secretariat 2014). Chimpanzees are sometimes killed intentionally–even poisoned–by people protecting their crops or as retribution for crop raiding (e.g., Brncic et al. 2010). Such trends are likely to increase as more natural habitat is converted to agricultural fields or plantations. Instances of crop foraging and encounters between people and Chimpanzees are becoming more frequent, especially in West Africa. This exacerbates negative perceptions and aggravates people’s attitudes towards Chimpanzees, thus potentially intensifying rates of killing, and subsequently fuelling the live trade with orphaned infants. Close to one thousand confiscated chimpanzees are now housed in sanctuaries in their range countries.Until the mid-1990s, much of Central Africa was a series of vast, roadless forest blocks, to which access was extremely difficult and where human population density was very low. In the last quarter of a century, however, almost all terra firma forest in the non-protected areas of the central Chimpanzee’s range has been assigned as logging concessions (Global Forest Watch 2016). This means that most of the once-remote, previously inaccessible forests are now covered by a network of logging roads (Laporte et al. 2007), which provides rapid access to hunters entering the forest and to traffickers taking consignments of bushmeat out of the forest to distant destinations – often towns and cities where bushmeat fetches the highest prices. In recent years, extractive industries have stimulated very high rates of human immigration and the creation of yet more access roads, which are also used for poaching (e.g., Edwards et al. 2014).2. Habitat loss and degradation(a) Subsistence/slash-and-burn agriculture: the conversion of forest to farmland across Africa has severely reduced the availability of Chimpanzee habitat. Such habitat loss is especially acute in West Africa, where it is estimated that more than 80% of the region’s original forest cover had been lost by the early 2000s (Kormos et al. 2003). Extensive land conversion in eastern DRC, western Rwanda and western Uganda has destroyed much of the sub-montane forest used by Chimpanzees. In Central Africa, annual rates of loss are lower, averaging about 0.14% (2000–2010 data; Desclée et al. 2014). Ongoing rapid growth in human populations is expected to lead to further widespread conversion of forest and woodland to agricultural land. Along the northern border of the forest-savanna boundary at about 6°N, forests are also being lost to fires and grazing of livestock.(b) Extractive industries – logging, mining and oil: logging generally has a negative impact on Chimpanzee densities due to habitat alteration (principally removal of important food trees) and disturbance (Morgan et al. 2007). As timber concessions undergo repeated cycles of logging, degradation over time will lead to profound changes in forest composition (Zimmerman and Kormos 2012), as the mature trees of certain species–some of high importance to Chimpanzees for food–are logged out. Mining of precious metals and mineral ores, and drilling for oil not only devastate wildlife habitat, but typically also lead to human inmigration and the building of roads, railways and other infrastructure. As with logging, the resulting increased accessibility to remote areas exacerbates risks to Chimpanzees through habitat degradation and fragmentation in areas not previously impacted by such anthropogenic pressures. The creation of open-pit mines leads to irretrievable loss of forest (Lanjouw 2014).(c) Industrial agriculture – as tropical Asia nears its capacity for oil-palm plantations, Africa has become the new frontier for this crop, which offers excellent economic prospects in countries with appropriate rainfall, soil and temperature conditions (Rival and Lavang 2014). Unfortunately, these areas coincide with good great ape habitat: 42.3% of the African apes’ range is suitable for oil palm (Wich et al. 2014), so the spread of plantations is likely to hit Chimpanzee populations hard in coming years. This situation is of special concern for Chimpanzees living outside protected areas. Changes caused by the rapid transformation of their habitat can have profound impacts on their diet, activity patterns, dispersal and ranging patterns, as well as introducing new pathogens and other risks linked to close proximity with people (Ancrenaz et al. 2015).(d) Major transportation infrastructure – huge road projects, which can be several kilometres wide, are currently underway across Africa and these will substantially fragment great ape habitat and add further to the area of “lost forest” (Laurance et al. 2015). This phenomenon is not confined to the African continent (Laurance et al. 2014).3. DiseaseThe second major driver of decline in central Chimpanzee populations is infectious disease, especially Ebola virus disease (EVD). Surveys carried out from the 1980s to the present day indicate that EVD caused a series of massive great ape die-offs in a large, mostly-intact forested area straddling the border between northeastern Gabon and northwestern Congo, which includes several national parks and logging concessions (Walsh et al. 2003, Maisels et al. 2004, 2013). Since the early 1990s, about 14% of their total area of distribution has been affected by Ebola virus (Ebolavirus). The virus is still present in the region’s forests: thus, as large areas can be affected by each outbreak, and transmission between individuals is rapid (Walsh et al 2007, 2009), large numbers of central Chimpanzees could succumb to this deadly virus within a span of weeks or months. Although both the Sangha and the Ngoko rivers are barriers to great ape movements (Anthony et al. 2007, Fünfstück et al. 2014), Ebolavirus can cross rivers and has already been detected to the east of the major river barrier between Odzala-Kokoua National Park and the Sangha River (Reed et al. 2014), thus a future outbreak in this region is a strong possibility. There is no evidence to date that the recent dramatic Ebola epidemic in West Africa has affected Chimpanzees, although Ebola killed Chimpanzees in Côte d’Ivoire in the mid-1990s (Formenty et al. 1999).Because Chimpanzees and humans are so similar, Chimpanzees succumb to many diseases that afflict humans. Infectious diseases, including outbreaks of respiratory disease and anthrax, are the main cause of death in several Chimpanzee populations that have been habituated to human presence (e.g., Goodall 1986, Nishida et al. 2003, Hanamura et al. 2006, Leendertz et al. 2006, Köndgen et al. 2008, Humle 2011). If not properly managed, research and tourism present opportunities for disease transmission between humans and Chimpanzees (Gilardi et al. 2015).For information on threats specific to each taxon, including climate change impacts, see the four Pan troglodytes subspecies accounts.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Feral cats and dogs on both islands present a similar threat (Yamada and Cervantes 2005). While mongooses have been largely controlled, feral cats now represent a major threat to this species.Habitat destruction, in the form of logging, has decreased the area of old growth forest to less than 10-30% of the area that existed in 1980 (Sugimura et al. 2000). Forest road construction, for the purpose of logging, encourages predator expansion in forests (Sugimura et al. 2000). Construction of resort facilities (e.g. golf courses) on Amami island have caused concern because the plans required destruction of rabbit habitat (McDowell 1996).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Human disturbance can be extremely detrimental to bat colonies, especially to non-volant young and hibernating adults, depending on the season and severity of the disturbance. Mines that are in close proximity to roads, towns, hiking trails or camp grounds are more susceptible to disturbance then those in remote areas with difficult access. There is a need for greater assurance that roosts will remain undisturbed and that future (potential) roost sites will be left when managing for bats in pinyon-juniper habitat.

Now that the grey squirrel has become established on the continent, it can be expected that it may ultimately spread throughout much of the red squirrel's range. Grey squirrels not only out-compete the smaller red squirrels, but also carry parapox virus, which is highly pathogenic to red squirrels. Grey squirrels can carry the virus without being affected, and recent (2006) UK studies have shown that 61% of apparently healthy grey squirrels have been exposed to the virus and may be carriers (C. McInnes in litt. 2006). When the virus is present, the grey squirrel can replace the red squirrel 20 times faster than normal replacement rate (Rushton et al. 2006). The virus has not yet been recorded in Italy.In Japan, this species is frequently sold as pets, having been imported from the mainland, and so the risk of the spread of this species across Japan is high, with much resulting concern for its impact on the native Sciurus lis.In Mongolia, unsustainable hunting for skins, for the international fur trade is a threat.

Here, human populations largely of lower income who  hunt local fauna for subsistence are increasing, thereby increasing the  threat to this otherwise abundant species (Matthee et al. 2004).  Sport hunting with dogs may also be impacting this species, as empirical  evidence suggests a wide range of species are affected and the sport  hunters are indiscriminate (Grey-Ross et al. 2010). Hunting is  suspected to be causing local declines (and possibly local extinctions)  in this species but it is uncertain whether there is a net decline in  the populations. Agriculture and habitat encroachment are also causing a  decline (Matthee et al. 2004). For example, in KwaZulu-Natal,  cane and fruit crops may be reducing the overall quality of foraging  area for the rock hare (Matthee et al. 2016). Natural habitat is  being lost at a rate of 1.2% per annum (between 1994 and 2011) in  KwaZulu-Natal, primarily due to agriculture (Jewitt et al. 2015).  Incidental predation on rock hares by domestic dogs may be increasing  as a result of agricultural and rural settlement expansion (Matthee et al.  2016). Since the 1900's, 21-50% of total habitat has been lost and  future loss (until 2022) is expected to remain between 21-50% (Matthee et al. 2004).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

The Corsican Hare is susceptible to accidental mortality due to difficulties distinguishing it from the European Hare by hunters (Angelici and Luiselli 2001). Potential hybridization between the European Hare and Corsican Hare could constitute a future threat to the species in continental Italy (Pierpaoli et al. 2003, Mengoni et al. 2014); however hybridization with the Iberian Hare and the European Hare has been assessed in Corsica (Pietri et al. 2011).

Highway construction may create more habitat than it destroys, as long-tailed shrews have been collected in the artificial talus slopes of road cuts (Conway and Pfitzer, 1952).

Hunting pressure is likely to cause local subpopulation declines  (Robinson et al. 2016).",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Tropical Africa has changed dramatically in recent years (Malhi et al. 2013) and increasing human densities are correlated with increasing rates of hunting. As a result, Red River Hog is also one of the primary prey species harvested for commercial purposes within the bush meat trade in most of Central Africa including Cameroon (Ayeni et al. 2001, Fa et al. 2006, Wilcox and Nambu 2007, Wright and Priston 2010, Macdonald et al. 2012), Central African Republic (Noss 1998), Democratic Republic of Congo (Mockrin et al. 2011, Dupain et al. 2012), Equatorial Guinea (Fa et al. 1995), Gabon (Thibault and Blaney 2003, Van Vliet and Nasi 2008), and some forested areas of West Africa such as Liberia (Bene et al. 2013) and Nigeria (Angelici et al. 1999, Okiwelu et al. 2009, Lameed et al. 2015). Together with the duikers, it is one of the most hunted species in the Congo Basin where a 79 % density decline was estimated from 1.7 individuals /km² in non-hunted areas to 0.36 individuals/km² in hunted areas (Lahm 1994). A significant effect of hunting on Red River Hog densities was observed in southern Gabon (Laurance et al. 2006). In some countries, Red River Hogs damage maize crops, and for this reason the species is persecuted by farmers.  In general these persecutions fail to eradicate Red River Hogs locally because they avoid active hunting through their nocturnal behaviour, and have a high reproductive output (Vercammen et al. 1993). Another threat is habitat loss (primary or secondary forest) and human encroachment in their habitat, which leads to overhunting. This is more likely to occur in West Africa. As an example, the Red River Hog has become very rare in Senegal and holds a status of integral protection (http://www.au-senegal.com/IMG/pdf/especes-protegees.pdf)",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Such habitats have been greatly reduced, with 82.6–99.9% declines in the extent of tallgrass prairies in 12 states and one Canadian province since European settlement (Bowles et al. 1998). Prairie mammals, such as the Prairie Deer Mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii), Prairie Vole (Microtus ochrogaster), and Franklin’s Ground Squirrel have suffered as a result (Bowles et al. 1998, Pergams and Nyberg 2001).In the eastern part of its range, S. franklinii is found primarily in small linear habitats. The continuing decline could be the result of the difficulty of dispersing individuals finding a suitable unoccupied habitat.  It is known that male juveniles disperse (Ellis 1982, Benjamin 1991), but it is unknown for what distance. Perhaps juvenile mortality has increased so much (automobiles and trains are obvious potential sources) that they rarely find suitable habitats during dispersal.Population fragmentation and isolation may also have longer-term effects through declines in vigour due to loss of genetic variability. Occupation of small, isolated habitat patches, as is the case in the USA, may hamper successful dispersal and promote inbreeding. It seems to be faring appreciably better in Canada (perhaps suitable habitat patches are larger and less isolated), although Canadian populations are also apparently declining. Habitat changes in Canada may be less detrimental. For example, in Canada, fire suppression has resulted in the succession of prairie to aspen parkland, where S. franklinii continues to be found. Although the habitat has changed, large contiguous tracts have been preserved, whereas in the USA only smaller prairie fragments and rights-of-way continue to provide habitat for S. franklinii.It opportunistically eats the seeds, fruits, and foliage of a great variety of plants, but vegetation probably does not comprise the majority of its diet. It has been thought to be an agricultural pest, and has at times been systematically exterminated. Millions of S. franklinii were killed for bounties ranging 1–10¢ per skin in the late 1800s (Bailey 1893). However, there is little evidence that they cause much crop damage. Spermophilus franklinii may be the least herbivorous of the ground squirrels, eating as much or more insect and other animal matter as vegetation (Bailey 1893, Ellis 1982, Hofmann 1999). There is, in fact, some evidence that they avoid row crops, and are only occasionally found in cover crops (Benjamin 1991). On the other hand, there is good evidence that S. franklinii opportunistically preys on waterfowl eggs, and there has been some extermination of the species for that reason (Sowls 1948, Balser et al.1968, Lynch 1972).""Poison peanuts"" (pelleted peanuts and zinc phosphide) are often ploughed into the ground by highway departments to control plains pocket gophers (Geomys bursarius); this probably affects S. franklinii in areas with both species. Pesticide use has played, and may still play, a role in the decline of this species. Scott et al. (1959) describe ""virtually annihilative losses"" of S. franklinii in areas treated with dieldrin, a pesticide banned in 1974. Deleterious effects from other pesticides still in use are possible.Internal parasites known to infest S. franklinii are the protozoans Eimeria franklinii and Trypanosoma hixsoni, the cestode Hymenolepsis diminuta, and the nematodes Capillaria chandleri, Citellinema bifurcatum, Physaloptera masino, Rictularia citelli, and Weinlandia citelli (Jackson 1961, p. 142).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

By the 1990s, available habitat for A. preussi  was already greatly reduced on the mainland (Oates 1996). For example, Cameroon’s forests have been severely eroded by cultivation, fire and collection of wood for fuel (Charlotte 2010, de Wasseige et al. 2012, Megevand et al. 2013). Intact highland forest, in which the species is most abundant, is converted across its range to grazing land, farmland and “farm bush” (e.g., Tyukavina et al. (2016)). Forest loss in the most recent year available (2014) was higher than in all previous years (from 2001) in Cameroon, and highest in 2011 and 2014 for Nigeria (World Resources Institute 2016).In some places human population density can reach 300 people per km² (WorldPop 2016), and human population growth in the three range states of the taxon is estimated to continue at roughly 2.7% annually for at least several decades (United Nations 2015, World Bank 2016). Throughout the highlands of the Cameroon volcanic line, much of the previously intact forest has been cleared for agriculture, and these forests suffered greatly in the 1980s and 1990s when the rise in coffee price first led to rapid clearing of the afro-alpine forests of the Cameroon highlands for growing coffee and subsequently—despite the price falling again—led to further clearing by farmers in the hope of future profits (Sunderlin et al. 2000). As a result, little montane forest remains in the mainland part of this species’ range and the largest remaining afroalpine forest block of West Africa is the Kilum-Ijim Forest Reserve which contains Mount Oku (Maisels et al. 2001).This species is highly susceptible to human predation because it is semi-terrestrial and relatively large-bodied. Hunting has led to a decline in its population across its range, but particularly on Bioko (Cronin et al. 2017). It was locally common in the Ndokbou, Kilum-Ijim, and Ebo Forests, and now populations have been extirpated as a result of overhunting (Dowsett-Lemaire & Dowsett 2001, Maisels et al. 2001). An intensive survey in 2009 in the Bakossi Mountains National Park failed to find any although they had been present some years earlier (Fonkwo et al. 2011). The montane and sub-montane forests of the Cameroon highlands are the last stronghold for A. preussi on the mainland, but firm data are not currently available on its rate of population decline. While it has been recorded in protected areas in Cameroon and Nigeria (e.g., Takamanda National Park and Cross River National Park), most of the remaining Cameroonian forest in the region lies outside protected areas, and are currently being eroded as a result of cultivations, bush fires and fuel wood collection (Oates et al. 2004). Hunting is also most severe outside protected areas and this monkey is disproportionately targeted given its large size and semi-terrestrial behaviour which make it easily accessible to hunters. The ongoing quest to convert forests to large-scale palm oil plantations in the region is likely to worsen these threats in the coming decade (Linder 2013). On Bioko, hunting intensity is high, including within the two protected areas, and recent infrastructure development has increased accessibility of remote areas of Bioko’s forests and core areas of the range of A. preussi on the island. A road leading to the summit of Pico Basilé was expanded and greatly improved between 2005-2010. This has greatly facilitated hunting within the reserve, primarily by hunters from Basile Fang, a village at the base of the road, which was founded in 2005 by professional hunters from continental Equatorial Guinea, Rio Muni (Grande Vega et al. 2013). In late 2014, a road bisecting the Gran Caldera Scientific Reserve was completed, eroding much of the isolation that had passively protected wildlife populations, including A. preussi, in the remote Gran Caldera de Luba (Cronin et al.  2015, Cronin et al. 2016), and contributed to increased hunting activity within the reserve (D.T. Cronin, unpublished data, 2015-2016).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The western part of the area in which it is found is reasonably inhospitable to human encroachment (Goodman 2003). It is probably at risk of predation by non-native carnivores, especially dogs. Hunting of this species is presumed to have increased significantly, particularly in the western of the  its range, since 2009 because of reductions in governance and  increased social instability following a coup d'etat, which has led to major increases in hunting of Radiated Tortoise Astrochelys radiata and other wildlife in the species's range: ""one of the most troubling trends is that poachers are now entering protected areas (Special Reserves, National Parks [including Tsimanampetsotsa National Park, the only protected area where Grandidier's Vontsira is found], World Heritage Sites) to collect tortoises and the staff there are poorly equipped to patrol and protect populations. The situation is exacerbated by several factors :1) Years of extreme drought that have led to diminished agricultural production and increased poverty, which leads people to tortoise hunting [and hunting of other species] for survival; 2) Enforcement action is often days away so that local officials do not have the capacity to stop poachers;  3) Severe habitat degradation has made the spiny forest the most endangered forest type in Madagascar. After burning and clearing for agriculture invasive plant species take over and today thick stands of Opuntia (prickly pear) and sisal (agave) dominate the landscape;   4) Current political instability has resulted in an increased open access to natural resources and illegal pet trade"" (Anonymous 2010).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Martinez and Lopez pers. comm.). Uncontrolled grassland fires are also a major threat especially if they jump to forest patches (J. Martinez pers. comm.). Critically, the proposed major improvement to a regional road will exacerbate deforestation and is likely to increase hunting pressure (Felton et al. 2006).The disappearance of the species from the type locality - La Laguna - indicates that they may be threatened locally by hunting (Felton et al. 2006). They are used as bait for fishing and cat hunting and some are captured for pets. Apparently the presence of sympatric primates such as Saimiri may also be a threat to C. olallae (J.

Callithrix aurita faces competition from other invasive marmosets (Pereira 2006, 2010, Melo and Rylands 2008, Pereira et al. 2008, Port-Carvaho and Kierulff 2009, Nogueira et al. 2011, Bechara 2012,  Carvalho et al. 2013, Carvalho 2015, Melo et al. 2015, Nunes 2015, Goncalves 2016), as well as hybridization with several of its congeners (Pereira 2010, Nogueira et al. 2011, Carvalho et al. 2013, Carvalho 2015). The species is sometimes captured for the pet trade. It is possible that introduced Callithrix jacchus and Callithrix penicillata have competed, and are still competing with and displacing this species, particularly in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. Many non-native Callithrix are also interbreeding with C. aurita resulting in hybridization, although the extent of this threat needs further investigation.In the state of Rio de Janeiro, these threats are considered quite intense. Based on studies by Pereira (2006, 2010) and Pereira et al. (2008), C. aurita is certainly at a critical stage of extinction risk, especially due to the introduction of C. penicillata, C. jacchus and Callithrix hybrids into protected areas where C. aurita occurs.In the state of São Paulo, the risk of hybridization and competition with exotic, invasive species is also extremely worrying, but there is still no accurate diagnosis of the current situation. In the Serra da Cantareira, invaders and hybrids are both present particularly in the area surrounding PE Cantareira, a situation that did not prevail 10 years ago (M.

Increased hunting associated with increased population density of people is responsible for severe decline of the Torricelli population, which may have been as low as 100 individuals in the 2000s. This represents a very substantial reduction of range and abundance in the memory of local villagers. Since the establishment of the Tenkile Conservation Alliance in 2001 (www.tenkile.com), and the agreement by 50 villages within the range of the Torricelli population to cease hunting them, hunting pressure has dropped substantially and the species is effectively protected in that area. This has arrested the decline of that population which is evidently now beginning to increase (Jim Thomas pers. comm. 2015).The population in the Bewani Ranges has not been surveyed. Possibly, the threat from hunting is lower for this populations because the human population in that area is smaller than in the Torricelli Range, but there are anecdotal reports that the Bewani Range population is subject to hunting.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

There has presumably been significant habitat disturbance and reduction in habitat quality as a result of logging - although how resilient the species might be to these changes is unknown.

Conversion of Gelada habitat to farmland and livestock grazing is common (Bergman and Beehner 2013) and soil erosion is a serious problem throughout the region (Nyssen et al. 2015). Grazing pressure is intense, and competition from domestic livestock has forced the Gelada to remain on the less productive gorge slopes in some areas (e. g. eastern Arsi) (Abu et al. 2018). Gelada densities are considerably lower in heavily populated areas than in undisturbed habitats (R. Burke, pers. obs.). Geladas are also harassed, shot or hunted with dogs as crop pests (R. Burke, pers. obs.) and occasionally sold locally as pets (Bergman and Beehner 2013). In the past, Geladas were trapped for zoos though this practice no longer occurs. Also, in the past, adult male numbers were reduced as a result of selective shooting for their capes of hair, which were made into ceremonial costumes used by the Oromo people (Dunbar 1977). The extent of this practice today is unknown. There are also historic records of Gelada capes being made into fur hats for tourists (Dunbar 1977). Government-sanctioned trophy hunting of Geladas by tourists is currently allowed in controlled hunting areas, although the extent and impact of this practice are unknown. Parasitic swellings caused by tapeworms (Taenia serialis) are a major cause of death in some Gelada populations (Nguyen et al. 2015, Schneider-Crease et al. 2017). Climate change poses a long-term threat to Geladas, especially for populations inhabiting higher elevations, where agriculture has previously been impossible or uncommon (Dunbar 1998).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

These factors include hunting by humans, habitat destruction, and diseases. Predation by large felids is also a contributor (Taber 1989, 1991, 1993; Altrichter and Boaglio 2004; Altrichter 2005). Of these, hunting pressure undoubtedly had the most negative impact until recently. All peccary species in the Chaco in all three countries are heavily hunted wherever they occur, even in national parks and reserve areas. Sowls (1984, 1997) has stated that the Chacoan Peccary constituted one of the most important sources of bush meat in the areas where they were previously abundant. Chacoan Peccary hides are thinner and much less valuable than those of the other peccary species. Fur buyers in Paraguay in 1988, for example, purchased Catagonus skins from settlers for about US$ 0.5 each compared to about US$ 8.0 for those of Pecari tajacu and US$ 5.0 for Tayassu pecari (Taber 1991). However, they still have been hunted and traded commercially. More recently, habitat destruction has become a major threat to this species. Although large tracts of intact bush survive, the rate of clearance for agriculture and cattle pasture in the Paraguayan and Argentinean Chaco is extremely high (Pearce 2011, Guyra Paraguay 2013). A study in the Argentine Chaco found that Chacoan Peccaries disappear when forest cover is reduced to less than 87% of the original cover (Altrichter and Boaglio 2004).Estimated rates of decline are given below:Argentina: From 1972 to 2001, 588,900 ha (c. 20% of the forests) was deforested at a rate of 2.2% a year. Assuming this rate has continued, and will continue, this implies a 33% habitat loss over a given 15 year period (three Catagonus generations). However, these total deforestation rates hide the impact of habitat degradation, which impacts virtually the whole area. Also, there are good reasons to believe that deforestation has greatly accelerated in the Argentine Chaco. The ongoing soy/commodity boom is having major impacts: e.g., over the last 10 years in the Chaco and Santiago del Estero provinces, soy cropland has grown from 284,000 ha to 1,513,000 ha. Some of this replaced smaller scale cotton cultivation, but most of this is new agro industrial expansions (Paolasso et al. 2012, Goldfarb and Zoomers 2013). This is putting tremendous pressure on remaining forest habitat.Paraguay: A recent publication reports an estimated loss of about 8,600 km2 corresponding to 6.4% of the Dry Chaco forest from 1990 to 2000 (Huang et al. 2009). At present, most of previously isolated forest areas of the Chaco are undergoing land modification with estimates of 5 km2 being cleared daily (Huang et al. 2009). The pressures of the habitat are definitively increasing, particularly in the prime Catagonus habitat in Central Chaco (A. Taber pers. comm., Guyra Paraguay 2013). The species probably only hangs on in the fringes of this area, as the far west is too dry for the species, and the east too wet. Proposals for major irrigation schemes from the Paraguay River which would further expand deforestation in the Central Chaco, and allow limited expansion to areas further west, are being discussed. Also, dryland-adapted transgenic crops (especially soy bean) are allowing more land to be put under extensive agriculture, further encroaching on the species in its prime habitat (Pearce 2011).Bolivia: This situation is less critical in this country. The Kaa-Iya National Park in the north of the range provides the largest stronghold for the species and it is suspected that the dry Chaco in Chuquisaca and Tarija is in relatively good conservation status with low expansion of large-scale agriculture and ranching. However, the Chaco forest around Kaa Iya is being lost to new developments and subsistence hunting pressure is high. The species is considered as Endangered in the country by the Red Book (Tarifa and Aguirre 2009).Based on the above observations, an estimated present and future 50% loss of Chacoan Peccary habitat over a three-generation time period (15 years) is expected. Also, hunting pressures have not abated, further increasing the likelihood of such a rate of decline.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

However, with extreme weather events becoming more common and all but one location for the species being located in Shark Bay, these fluctuations are a cause for concern. Introduced rats and mice are also a concern, but to a lesser degree than introduced predators.On the mainland this species was probably extirpated through predation by introduced cats, dogs, and foxes, modification of vegetation by rabbits and stock, and possibly changed fire regimes in parts of the range (Maxwell et al. 1996).

Forests continue to be cleared at the large and medium scale for oil-palm plantations that can each cover hundreds of square kilometres. On a smaller scale, logging for timber (both legal and illegal) remains a threat, as does the creation of new roads, which fragment populations and gives access to illegal settlements and further encroachment for agriculture and plantations (also frequently illegal), and to wildlife poachers. When industrial plantations are established, the resident orangutans are forced to seek refuge in adjacent forest patches, if any remain, but in the long term they are likely to succumb to malnutrition and starvation due to competition and limited resources. Such forest fragments are often subsequently cleared as well.Sumatran Orangutans are frequently killed deliberately, completely illegally, and surviving infants end up in an illegal pet trade. This trade tends to be a by-product of habitat conversion, for example, if an Orangutan is found in an isolated patch of trees during the conversion process, there is a high probability it will be killed. Sumatran Orangutans are also regularly killed in human-wildlife conflict situations, for example, if raiding fruit crops on farmland at the forest edge (Wich et al. 2012). By far the largest single current threat to the Sumatran Orangutan comes from a spatial land-use plan ratified by the government of Aceh Province in 2013. Conservation of the Leuser Ecosystem being obligated by Aceh’s own special autonomy law (Law No 11 2006) due to its designation in 2007/8 as a National Strategic Area for its environmental function (which requires its inclusion and special consideration at all levels of spatial planning). But alarmingly the current Aceh spatial plan completely ignores the Leuser Ecosystem’s existence. Both the provincial and national governments have publicly acknowledged the illegality of the Aceh spatial plan, but to date it remains officially ratified at the provincial level and has not been formally cancelled by the national government. As of early 2016, legal challenges are attempting to rectify this situation and to have the current Aceh spatial plan replaced with one that complies fully with all relevant laws, is based on sound environmental sensitivity analyses, and affords appropriate protection to the Leuser Ecosystem in accordance with existing legislation. However, whilst the status quo persists, the Aceh Provincial Spatial Plan of 2013 allows huge tracts of Sumatran Orangutan habitat to be designated for new plantations, and timber and mining concessions, and will lead to many more Sumatran Orangutans being lost in the ensuing years (Wich et al. 2016). The existing plan also effectively legitimizes numerous roads cut illegally through the forest, which further fragment Orangutan populations and provide yet more access to hunting and encroachment.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Some level of hunting pressure is likely to be almost universal. A rapid, ongoing expansion of wealthy social strata in Lao PDR, Cambodia, Viet Nam and China is in part driven by illegal trade in timber, wild meat and other forest resources, and by large infrastructure projects. This social change has driven a recent massive increase in demand for wildlife as luxury food in urban centres, particularly in China and Viet Nam; civets are a large part of this (Bell et al. 2004). There is no evidence that Large-spotted Civet is specifically sought (nor that it is eschewed); it is safe to assume that it comprises part of the general off-take, given that most methods are of low selectivity, such as lines of snares suitable for animals of this size class set at high density with drift fences (Willcox et al. 2012). In Viet Nam “the free market economy has resulted in feverish periods of trade in wild species nationwide, with negative impacts on biodiversity” (Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2004). In Cambodia, the same factor has fostered a thriving wildlife-meat market and hunting of species for international wildlife trade (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins 2006, Maxwell et al. 2007), and the intensity of hunting there for some species is likely to exceed even that in Viet Nam. This reflects the logistical ease of hunting and trading with few controls and the relative abundance of high-value quarry species (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008).In many countries, the species's habitat use means that in many forest blocks it occurs mostly round the margins (lowlands) with the interior (often mostly hill forest) being unsuitable. This may insulate it to some extent from the worst of industrial snaring, because the peripheral areas are mostly already defaunated of high market-value species. Set against this, it is more likely in these areas to be encountered during general subsistence forest resource-gathering activities (e.g., firewood, food for domestic consumption, construction materials); people engaging in these are in many areas invariably accompanied by dogs, carrying guns and alert for any opportunistic hunting possibility for animals of this size-class and over. Of its current range states, Cambodia and, presumably, Myanmar both have multiple large protected areas comprising extensive areas at suitable altitude and terrain for this species. This gives more solid long-term options, but few of these are effectively managed at present, and hunting in some is known to be at very high levels.Hunting is compounded by habitat loss. From the 1970s and the 1990s, large areas of lowland forest were converted to agriculture across parts the species's range, particularly in China, Thailand and Viet Nam (Lynam et al. 2005, Roberton 2007, Wang Ying-xiang pers. comm. 2006). Large areas were also logged and otherwise encroached. While this might well have had little direct effect on suitability for Large-spotted Civet, heavy hunting almost invariably accompanies such operations. Post-logging, the typically increased accessibility and fragmentation of habitat increases the threat of hunting and the negative effects on susceptible species (Lynam et al. 2005). While large-scale conversion of the small remaining tracts of lowland forest has mostly slowed in these countries since the 1990s, Lao PDR and, in particular, Cambodia are still within their main phase of conversion; and political and thus economic changes in Myanmar suggest the start of a similar upsurge there. Cambodia is presently seeing massive deforestation of the lowlands, particularly for local and plantation-scale agriculture; this is unquestionably reducing the extent of suitable habitat for Large-spotted Civet both outside and inside protected areas (T.N.E. Gray  pers. comm. 2014, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). In Myanmar, there is a major trend in conversion of forest to plant oil agriculture, particularly in lowlands (J.W. Duckworth and Than Zaw pers. comm. 2006).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

This growth has been accompanied by widespread environmental degradation and will continue to negatively affect natural habitats. Across Nigeria, land area devoted to agriculture and plantations (crop and grazing lands, floodplain agriculture, irrigation and livestock projects, and tree and forest plantations) increased by nearly 84,000 km² between 1976 and 1995. More than half of the country’s undisturbed lowland moist forest was lost during that same time frame (from 25,951 to 12,114                    km²) (Geomatics International et al. 1998). From 1990–2015, net forest loss across Nigeria continued at a rate of 3.5% annually, resulting in a loss of ~4,100 km² each year – more than any other African nation. During this period, Nigeria lost 59.4% of its forested area and 98.7% of its primary forest (FAO 2015). During the latter part of this period, from 2000–2015, the rate of forest loss across Nigeria accelerated (5%) (FAO 2015), and the percent of forest cover declined from 14.4% to 7.7% (World Bank 2017). Conversion of forested areas to farmland is a major contributor to this decline; for the decade ending in 2008, Nigeria converted more land to annual crops than did any other tropical nation (Phalan et al. 2013). The southeastern region of Nigeria, where Sclater’s Monkey occurs, has among the highest human population densities in the country and one of the highest in Africa. As a result, most natural forest across this species’ range has been converted to cultivated land; unregulated logging and activities associated with oil exploration and production have added to the destruction (Oates et al. 1992, Baker and Olubode 2008).

The Atlantic coastal forests have been greatly modified for agriculture, especially in coastal Cameroon, where industrial agricultural plantations (bananas, oil palm, rubber) and smallholder farming have replaced much of the original forest.The taxon is also threatened by illegal hunting for bushmeat throughout its range, both for local consumption and for commercial sale to distant urban populations. Its large body size (~10-11 kg for males, ~5-6 for females (Ehardt 2013, Oates 2011), semi-terrestrial habits, large group size and loud vocalisations mean that it is easily detected from a distance, easily shot (or snared), and is selected by bushmeat hunters as it provides more meat per individual shot and cartridge expended. The species was highly intolerant of hunting pressure in a study in Korup NP in Cameroon (Linder and Oates 2011).Human population growth in the range states of C. torquatus continues at roughly 2.7% annually and will not slow down for several decades (UN 2015, World Bank 2017). More and more land will be required for food for these people, and the increasing industrialisation of agriculture in all of these countries will mean that more and more forest is converted monocultures of food crops and rubber, which are highly unsuitable for these monkeys.Road access into once-remote forests has increased greatly during the last 20–30 years and will continue to do so at an accelerated rate (Laporte et al. 2007, Laurance et al. 2015), facilitating hunting and transport of bushmeat to both local markets and distant urban centres (Abernethy et al. 2013, Ziegler et al. 2016). Habitat loss will also greatly increase along the broad corridors created by these roads (Laurance et al. 2015). By 2050 the region will have little, if any, land left untouched by hunting (Nasi et al. 2011).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Although Grivet Monkeys have a long list of likely nonhuman predators, many of these species’ numbers have declined in recent years. Thus, for the Grivet, there are presumed to be no major predatory threats. Their affinity for crop-raiding may result in human-wildlife conflict that could impact their numbers in some locales as pests are killed, but hunting grivets for meat by local humans is not widely reported.As in other areas of Africa, large-scale farming and expansion of human habitations clearly plays a role in reducing suitable habitat. Furthermore, Zinner et al. (2002) noted that the influx of refugees from Ethiopia and Sudan into Eritrea exacerbated loss of habitat and escalated human-wildlife conflict.Additionally, genetic analyses of Grivet Monkey populations living in a large geographic area along the Awash River (Ethiopia) found a low level of variability compared with many other cercopithecines (Shimada and Shotake 1997). Turner (1981) found similar lack of diversity in a blood protein study of Ethiopian grivets. These findings are explained as a likely consequence of recent and repeated series of rapid habitat expansions following dramatic climate conditions as suggested by paleoclimatic data (Shimada and Shotake 1997). If so, Grivet Monkeys may be one of many primate species facing challenges due to climate change. Further studies are therefore recommended.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

The role of hunting and traditional knowledge is currently under investigation in the YUS Conservation Area by James Cook University and Tree Kangaroo Conservation Program researchers.  At higher elevations, forest wildfires caused by prolonged periods of drought is a major threat to these ecosystems. During an intensive El Niño event in 1997 a major wildfire destroyed upper montane forests in large parts of the Sarawaged and Finisterre Ranges, reducing favourable habitat in several regions.

On the Atherton Tableland, increased fragmentation makes them more vulnerable to predation by dogs, although strategic reforestation on the Atherton Tableland opens the possibility of some recovery of its original area of occupancy in the future (Maxwell et al. 1996). In agricultural areas where it occurs, predation by dogs and road kills represent threats. Climate change and associated factors have been predicted to have a major detrimental impact on this species, acting directly or indirectly through reduction in rainforest area, reduction in foliar nitrogen concentration, habitat degradation due to increased incidence of severe cyclones, increased incidence of high temperatures, and reduced incidence of free water in mist (Kanowski 2001, 2004; Kanowski et al. 2001; Winter 2004).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Possibly excessive livestock grazing may have contributed to the decline in some areas (livestock may crush near-surface burrows and compete for food with kangaroo rats) (see USFWS 1998). Between 1972 and 1980 most of the remaining habitat was converted from native vegetation to cultivated agricultural crops due in part to an abundance of irrigation water supplied by recently completed water delivery systems.More recently, the conversion of habitat to agricultural uses has slowed substantially, but urban and industrial developments, petroleum and mineral exploration and extraction, new energy and water conveyance facilities, and construction of communication and transportation infrastructures continue to destroy habitat and increase the threats to the species by reducing and further fragmenting populations (USFWS 1998).

Fox control by government agencies involves the use of bounty systems without any serious studies on population abundance or the real damage that this species may cause. In rural areas, direct persecution in retaliation for or prevention of predation on lambs is also common, even where hunting is officially illegal and despite the true economic impact of predation being unquantified (Lucherini and Luengos Vidal 2008, M. Lucherini pers. obs. 2015).Most of the species' range has suffered massive habitat alteration. For instance, the Pampas, which represents a large proportion of the species' distribution range, has been affected by extensive cattle breeding and agriculture. Approximately 0.1% of the original 500,000 km² range remains unaffected. However, due to the species' adaptability, the Pampas Fox seems able to withstand the loss and degradation of its natural habitat, as well as hunting pressure. Since no studies are available on its population dynamics in rural ecosystems, caution is required, since the sum of these threats may eventually promote the depletion of fox populations. Hunting pressure has resulted in diminished populations in the provinces of Tucumán (Barquez et al. 1991) and Salta (Cajal 1986) of north-western Argentina.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

The general trends of decline even in the best managed Tahr habitats indicate that the total population of the species does not exceed 2000 at present and a conservative estimate would place the numbers within the 1,800-2,000 range (Daniels et al., 2006). Currently, the only populations with more than 300 individuals are in Eravikulam National Park and in the Grass Hills in Anamalai. The most recent information from the Nilgiri hills (Mukurti Wildlife Sanctuary), which previously had more than 300 tahr (Davidar, 1978; Rice, 1984; Schaller, 1971), indicates that only between 75 and 100 individuals remain. Wattle (Acacia mearnsii) plantations and cattle apparently no longer threaten the Mukurti population, so their decline is probably due solely to illegal hunting. The status of the other smaller populations (many of which are less than 100 individuals), which are also subject to continued illegal hunting, can be considered precarious. Similar population decreases and threats to the species were reported in a survey in Kalakad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve (Rai and Johnsingh, 1992).Populations of these animals are small and isolated, making them vulnerable to local extinction. Habitat patches for Nilgiri tahr are naturally discontinuous, but some habitat fragmentation may have anthropogenic causes (C. Rice pers. comm., 2008). The species faces competition from domestic livestock, whose overgrazing has allowed for the invasion of graze-resistant weedy species into preferred meadows, thus in competition with the native grasses that tahr prefers (Mishra and Johnsingh, 1998).  Continued conversion of tahr habitat to agricultural land has resulted in a present distribution that is about one-tenth of its historical range (Mishra and Johnsingh, 1998; Kannery, 2002; IUCN, 2004).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Common Hippo’s reliance on fresh water habitats appears to put them at odds with human populations and adds to their vulnerability, given the growing pressure on fresh water resources across Africa (WWC 2004). Habitat loss stems from water diversion related to agricultural development (Cole 1992, Jacobsen and Kleynhaus 1993, Viljoen 1995, Viljoen and Biggs 1998) as well as larger-scale development in and around wetland areas (Jacobsen and Kleynhaus 1993, Harrison et al. 2007). In many West and Central African countries, habitat loss has contributed to a growing regional threat of population fragmentation, as isolated and small populations of hippos are confined to protected areas, with poor or even no management and increasing pressure from local communities (Brugière and Scholte 2013).   Reports of human mortalities from Common Hippo interactions have also increased in recent years, another indication of habitat loss. In some agricultural areas, hippo population increases in restricted habitat has also fueled conflict (Kanga 2013). Ten countries reported growing numbers of hippo-human conflicts, in several cases exacerbated by drought conditions. Conflicts with fishermen and gold miners have also been reported (Mackie et al. 2013, Mozambique).  In many countries where Common Hippos are found, populations are not confined to protected areas. Although it is likely that the majority of the overall Common Hippo population reside in some form of protected area (national park, biosphere, game or forest reserve, sanctuary, conservation area), the proportion of protected Hippos likely varies among countries. For countries with a high proportion of Hippo populations outside protected areas, the likelihood of persistence is much lower as there is no impediment to hunting or incentive for habitat protection.   Illegal or unregulated hippo hunting has been found to be particularly high in areas of civil unrest (Kayanja 1989, Shoumatoff 2000, Hillman Smith et al. 2003). At the beginning of 21st century, field surveys found that Common Hippo populations in DR Congo have declined more than 95% as a result of intense hunting pressure, during more than eight years of civil unrest and fighting (Hillman Smith et al. 2003). Similarly, hippo hunting by military forces during civil war in Mozambique during 1980-1992 resulted in decline of more than 70% of the hippo population in the country (Mackie et al. 2013). Widespread poaching for meat has also been reported from Burkina Faso, Burundi, Ivory Coast, and South Sudan (Associated Press 2003, Dibloni 2010, H. Rainey pers. comm.) as well as from politically stable countries like Zambia (Wilbroad and Milanzi 2010). Estimates of the amount of Hippo ivory illegally exported were found to be increasing in the 2008 RLA. A 1994 assessment by TRAFFIC, the monitoring agency of international trade for the IUCN, reported that illegal trade in Hippo ivory increased sharply following the international elephant ivory ban in 1989. Between 1991-1992, approximately 27,000 kg of hippo canine teeth were exported, an increase of 15,000 kg from 1989–1990 estimates (Weiler et al. 1994). In 1997, more than 1,700 Hippo teeth en route from Uganda to Hong Kong were seized by customs officials in France (TRAFFIC 1997). Five thousand kilos of Hippo teeth (from an estimated 2,000 Hippos) of unknown origins were exported from Uganda in 2002 (New Vision 2002). Seizure records of illegal ivory in 2007 and 2008 corroborate that this trend continues as Hippo teeth and products from Hippo teeth have been consistently found with seized ivory and ivory products from elephant tusks.   Although there are several ongoing research projects in captive facilities and with wild populations, little research has focused directly on common hippo conservation. Muwanika et al. (2003) considered the genetic consequences of the intense unregulated hunting that occurred in Uganda in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Based on both nuclear and mitochondrial data, they conclude that although populations were reduced to 70% of initial population size, their current levels of genetic diversity are substantial and not a cause for concern. This suggests that for some populations, once the hunting disturbance is removed, recovery from intense hunting is likely and may not result in detrimental long-term population effects. More recent findings comparing mitochondrial and nuclear DNA suggests that the remaining hippo population currently faces genetic isolation and urges the need for specific protection and regional restoration programmes (Stoffel et al. 2015).  Lewison (2007) evaluates the relative impacts of the known threats to persistence—habitat loss (from agricultural or larger-scale development) and hunting pressure—on a model population. While accounting for rainfall variability and demographic stochasticity, the model results suggest that combinations of habitat loss and even moderate levels of adult mortality from hunting (1% of adults) can lead to relatively high probabilities of population declines over the next 30–40 years.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

Predation by feral cats is also regarded as a threat, albeit a minor one (Woinarski et al. 2014). In Queensland, there was a gradual reduction in vegetation clearing that peaked in 2009, but changes in policy and legislation since that time have once more led to an increase (Maron et al.2015).

These threats extend to populations within national parks and forests, including illegal agricultural development inside the parks. In Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park in southwestern Sumatra, deforestation rates are linked to the coffee market; coffee plantations serve to completely strip arboreal primates of their canopy habitats (O'Brien et al. 2004). The expansion of oil palm plantations is a major cause of forest loss on Sumatra. In nearby Java, agile gibbons are one of the most commonly seen gibbons in the wildlife markets (Nijman 2005). The species' status in West Malaysia is uncertain; in Indonesia, it was certainly affected by fires and deforestation of the 1990s.

Brockelman pers. comm.).Construction of roads through protected areas (for example, the Security Highway through Nam Poyi in Lao PDR, the north-south highway in Peninsular Malaysia) may also pose a threat since it promotes forest clearance and strip development, possibly increases fragmentation, and increases access by hunters into protected areas. Ongoing localized forest loss due to shifting agriculture and commercial plantations of palm oil poses a threat.

The main threats come from forest destruction and degradation due to agriculture, squatters, hunting and extractivism, especially for palm hearts, and, most seriously, from burgeoning human occupation through land speculation and tourism (see Vivekananda 2001).A study by Dietz et al. (2000) examined inbreeding depression in small (50 or less) isolated populations of L. rosalia. They concluded that it reduced probability of long-term survival by about one-third.

Although current hunting pressures are virtually unknown, continued illegal hunting persists usually associated with local conflicts with fishermen (Chehebar 1991, González and Utrera, 2001, IBAMA 2001), which have been suggested to represent one of the most serious threats to this species. Additionally, the high level of habitat destruction by deforestation, mining, and water pollution are likely to contribute to the species rareness (Melendres 1978, Gallo 1986, Chehebar 1990, Alho and Blacher 1991, Alho et al. 1998, González and Utrera 2001) and may be responsible for population decline and isolation.In Mexico and maybe in other regions, industrial waste spills into rivers have increased the amount of heavy metals, with a consequent increase in deaths of Neotropical Otters (Gallo-Reynoso 1997). Finally, otters killed on roads have been  reported in the Guianas (Duplaix 2004), south and southeastern Brazil (and likely in other localities (C.S. Trinca, pers. obs.)), which may represent an additional threat to the species survival and can be associated to increasing levels of habitat fragmentation.

Hunting is an increasing threat throughout the range of this taxon, which is eaten locally for food in villages and traded to urban populations. There are large areas of “empty forest” in its range, especially in the west, where the habitat is intact but the animals have been hunted out (see subspecies accounts for more detail). Human populations in the range states of the taxon continue to grow at roughly 2.7% annually and this rate will not slow down for several decades (UN 2015, World Bank 2016). Road access into once-remote forests – even around protected areas – has hugely increased over the last 20-30 years (Laporte et al. 2007), facilitating increased hunting and transport of bushmeat for commercial trade in both local markets and distant urban centres (Abernethy et al. 2013, Ziegler et al. 2016). In Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, and in East Africa (including eastern DRC and Rwanda), the species is subject to habitat modification, as intact forest is converted to farmland and “farm bush” which can be seen clearly in Tyukavina et al. (2016). Historically, forest loss has been relatively low in the Gabon, CAR and Congo parts of this taxon’s range (Hansen et al. 2013) due to low human population densities and selective (as opposed to clearcutting) logging practices. However, in Congo, Cameroon, DRC and Equatorial Guinea, forest loss in the years 2014-2016 was higher than in all previous years (from 2001) (WRI 2017; Gabon’s figures not available), and this will greatly increase in the future as industrial agriculture expands further, removing habitat suitable for various forest-obligate species (Wich et al. 2014).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In the past, habitat loss was due mainly to timber harvest and the creation of exotic plantations such as tea, eucalyptus and coffee. Habitat degradation seems to the biggest threat to the conservation of lion-tailed macaques wherever they occur in Kerala (Easa et al. 1997). In private forests and plantations, change in land use is a problem for the species. Hunting is a second major threat, especially in certain parts of its range. In one location, Coorg, with a large area of remaining wet evergreen habitat, the species is highly threatened by non-subsistence and subsistence hunting for food (Kumara and Singh 2004). In some areas, primate meat is preferred as food, and so the animals face serious hunting threats (Kumara and Singh 2004). A local trade exists for pets (Molur et al. 2003), and in Coorg the animals were often hunted in the past for “medicinal” uses. Certain features of the reproductive biology and ecology of this species (such as large inter-birth periods, seasonal resource availability, and female competition for mating opportunities) combine to make it intrinsically rare in the wild. The populations already reduced to low numbers are in special need of active management (Singh et al. 2006).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

On this basis, the only predictable threats are habitat conversion (for large development projects like roads and dams), persecution in retribution for its destruction of bees-box contents (particularly in Kodagu) and, potentially, increase in tourism. After sustained large-scale deforestation within Nilgiri Marten range around a century ago, rates have slowed considerably in recent decades. Large development projects have been destroying some habitat, and fragmenting what remains, at low rates for the last three generations (21 years); these rates are not expected to rise significantly in the next 21 years. With increasingly effective legal protection, hunting currently is not a major issue for the survival of the species in most of its range.

It is further projected for Borneo that climate change is particularly likely to have negative effects on highland species such as Bornean Ferret Badger because potential upslope range shifts would be impossible (Struebig et al. 2015). Although its habitat associations are too poorly known to be sure that the recent widespread habitat change in its range poses an imminent threat, the ongoing paucity of incidental records (such as road-kills) in converted habitats suggests that the species is threatened by the ongoing land-cover transformations. There is no information on its susceptibility to whatever hunting levels occur in its range. It is not significantly traded, but it is no doubt caught in non-selective traps.

It is likely that decline occurred due directly to storm surges across the entire island (killing individuals) and/or ongoing and episodic reduction in vegetation (probably also due to storm surge) (Woinarski et al. 2014).",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Information about habitat availability is conflicting, with Frías et al. (1988) suggesting that very little suitable habitat was left, whereas Meier (2004) reported that suitable habitat still was widely available. A military installation was previously located on these islands and it is believed that during this time hunting by military personnel was intensive. Fisherman use the island and many accidental fires have resulted from their cooking fires and mosquito control.

The species is hunted for venison and skin (Harris 2008). Ohtaishi and Gao (1990) reported that 500 animals were being killed annually for skins which were sold to local markets during the 1980s. Sheng (1998) reported that yearly harvest may have exceeded this figure. Although there is chronic poaching throughout China, hunting pressure within M. crinifrons range is likely to be considerably lower than in the ‘tropical’ southwestern provinces. There is still hunting but local residents in general don’t go all out in hunting remnant wildlife, and in recent years following gun confiscation and a better economy, the more resilient species like small carnivores and muntjac are probably on the recovery in many areas (P. L. Chan pers. comm. 2014). Specifically on the basis of survey work in two sites in southern (unprotected; M. crinifrons possibly present; close to Huangshan) and northern  (protected; M. crinifrons absent) Anhui hunting occurs but does not seem to be a serious problem; contrasting markedly with fieldwork sites in southwesternmost China where hunting is so intense that extirpations of many species have occurred and densities of all large bodied mammals are extremely low (Lau et al. 2010, P. L. Chan pers. comm. 2014). There is also relatively little original habitat left in the Black Muntjac range and they appear to utilise secondary vegetation as long as hunting is controlled. Furthermore probably a majority of remaining occupied habitat now lies within protected areas, and probably an even higher proportion of the remaining Black Muntjac. Habitat loss may no longer be a significant threat, as in some remote hilly areas agricultural and other anthropogenic landuses are being abandoned and forest is recovering, whilst still in easily accessible low-lying areas remaining forested habitat patches are slowly being developed as towns expand (P.L. Chan pers. comm. 2014). But few deer are likely to persist in habitat patches at lower elevations.Protected areas in Eastern China appear to be better managed than those in the southwest, (perhaps also helped by local communities that do not have a strong hunting culture), further suggesting that Black Muntjac maybe relatively secure in several areas. Hunting pressure within Tongbashan NR, Huanggangshan NR, and Yangjifeng NR is not very serious (Jianhuan YANG pers. comm. 2014). Published studies from Gutianshan and Jiulongshan Nature Reserves (see population above) also suggest that Black Muntjac is relatively secure within them. The population in Wuyishan National Nature Reserve is considered to be secure (Songlin Cheng pers. comm. 2014).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The number of occupied caves has substantially decreased. In Missouri, 26 of 66 caves used historically by this species and surveyed in 1994 showed no evidence of recent use, a similar decline has occurred in Florida (Layne 1978). Decline began with cave disturbance associated with saltpeter production during the Civil War. Some of the largest colonies were lost as a result of cave commercialization. Some caves were improperly gated. Cave disturbance has been the major factor in the decline. Cave protection efforts have greatly reduced this threat. The species is especially vulnerable due to its high fidelity to particular favored caves, which meet very specific roosting requirements, therefore, they are very sensitive to disturbance, including the mere presence of humans with lights, disturbance may result in bats moving to less favourable roosting places (Tuttle and Kennedy 2005).White-nose Syndome (WNS) has already killed roughly six million bats having spread over two thousand kilometres within North America, and most of its impact is on eastern populations of bats, like Myotis grisescens (Alves et al. 2014). This disease is considered as one of the major threats to populations of this species. Habitat loss and degradation and contamination from pesticides also are considered a cause of decline. Natural flooding and impoundment of waterways has resulted in temporary impacts to some caves and the complete submersion and loss of other important cave sites. The use of forestry insecticides and crop pesticides in areas adjacent to riparian corridors where gray bats forage may reduce the prey base or kill bats that ingest contaminated insects (Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center). Some maternity and hibernating colonies are susceptible to human disturbance (Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center).",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Few nursery roost sites are known and many of these have been lost, although numbers in hibernation sites have shown a slower decline in The Netherlands.  Water pollution may also be a threat; the species already has a relatively restricted foraging habitat of broad, open flat water of canals, rivers and lakes with relatively open banks, with possibly some further  seasonal (summer) restriction within utilized habitat. Such restrictions in summer may be opportunistic rather than enforced, and it may be that the requirements for wider dispersal in spring, and possibly autumn, is more of a conservation problem than concentration in summer in good foraging habitat close to the roost.

Observations during wildlife surveys in the upper Tshuapa Basin, between the Tshuapa and the Lomami rivers, suggest that P. tholloni may be one of the first primate species hunted out, because they are large and slow to flee (A. Vosper pers. comm. 2007). In some areas, for example Lukuru, P. tholloni appears to be targeted by local hunters because they have a preference for its meat, and some hunters say that church teachings attributed the flavour of P. tholloni to divine intervention (Thompson 2000). However, hunting threats are not uniform, and the species does not always appear to be selected for. For example, before the establishment of the LNP, in the Obenge sector where P. tholloni is common, six shotgun hunters who were monitored on 17 hunting trips, killed P. tholloni only twice (a total 4 individuals; J. Hart pers. obs, 2009). These hunters killed other primate species (total 14 individuals, mostly Cercopithecus spp.), as well duikers and pigs. Five bow hunters in the same sector were monitored on nine hunts, and killed P. tholloni five times (a total of 7 individuals), which represented the entire kill for these hunters (J. Hart, pers. obs.). Market surveys, where groups of similarly-aged fresh carcasses are displayed together, suggest multiple kills at the same event (Thompson 2000, Thompson and Hart 2015). P. tholloni carcasses represented 36% of 229 carcasses recorded over a one-month period at the Basankusu markets (Dupain and van Elsacker 1999, cited in Thompson 2000). A market survey in Lusambo in 2011 recorded P. tholloni accounting for 5% of total carcasses (G. Paluku and E. Mpaka, Lukuru Foundation pers. comm. to via J. Hart, 2016). Although hunting is the main conservation threat, habitat loss and degradation due to logging and conversion of forest to agricultural landscapes is a growing threat to this species (Harris et al. 2017). For example, the Sankuru Reserve and Lusambo region, important forest areas in the southeast of P. tholloni’s range, have been identified as new hot spots of forest loss from 2000-2014 (Harris et al. 2017).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Expansion of the agricultural frontier, inadequate livestock management and water extraction for a growing mining and petroleum industry activity in the South American highlands and the Patagonian steppe are altering the Andean Cat habitat. The Andean Cat will be affected negatively by global climate change throughout most of its range by a decrease in the geographic distribution (Bennett et al. in progress) and more recently by rapid expansion of exploitation of shale oil and gas through hydraulic fracturing or fracking in northern Patagonia (Walker et al. 2013).  Hunting by local people who consider the Andean Cat a predator of their small domestic livestock has been frequently reported particularly in some regions of Argentina, Chile and Peru (Iriarte 1998, Cossíos and Madrid 2003, Lucherini and Merino 2008). Andean Cats are being killed by herders in Patagonia in retaliation for predation (Novaro et al. 2010). These cats are also killed by dogs accompanying local shepherds and in north-western Argentina high mortality rates due to hunting by local people have also been inferred (C. Tellaeche and M. Lucherini unpub. data). Cossios et al. (2007) also reported the hunting of Andean and Pampas Cats for food and for traditional medicine in central Peru.  Particularly in Bolivia, Peru and northern Chile, the Andean Cat (as well as the Pampas Cat) is considered a sacred animal according to indigenous Aymara and Quechua traditions. Throughout much of its range, dried and stuffed specimens are kept by local people for use in harvest festivals (Iriarte 1999, Sanderson 1999, Villalba et al. 2004, Cossios et al. 2007, Villalba et al. 2012). Hunting for such cultural practices may represent a significant threat to the species.  The Short-tailed Chinchilla was likely to have been a major prey species for the Andean Cat, but the species was hunted nearly to extinction for the fur trade (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In most of its range, the main prey of the Andean Cat is now the Mountain Vizcacha (Walker et al. 2007, Viscarra 2008, Napolitano et al. 2008, Torrico 2009), which lives in patchily distributed small colonies and has also been reduced by hunting pressure. This may result in a highly fragmented distribution for the Andean Cat. Intra-guild competition, especially with the Pampas Cat, for Mountain Vizcacha prey, could negatively impact the Andean Cat (Lucherini and Luengos Vidal 2003, Walker et al. 2007, Reppucci 2012).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

These threats have further intensified during the last decade as a result of growing human population and migration, and increased economic activities accompanied by a rise in income levels. A survey in 2013 found that many of the forests across the range of P. epieni now lacked any large trees, and that even medium-sized trees were scarce, while an analysis of remote-sensing imagery indicated annual rate of forest loss across this range of 1.2% between 1991 and 2013  (Ikemeh 2015)",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Wild animals are likely to be the primary source, but there is also some illegal trade from captive animals (Nowell 2007). Clouded Leopard exploitation for pelts are well documented in several countries, including the infamous Tachilek market along the Thai–Myanmar border. The frequency of Clouded Leopard parts available at market indicates increased pressure from hunting (Oswell 2010). Data from Tachilek on the Myanmar–Thailand border (19 surveys, 1991–2013) and Mong La on the Myanmar–China border (seven surveys, 2001–2014) show that the most common species in trade was the Clouded Leopard Neofelis nebulosa (482 individuals, observed in 22/24 surveys. However, the trade of cat parts from Myanmar into Thailand has diminished and reaffirms the role of China in the trade of cats out of Myanmar (Nijman and Shepherd 2015).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Letnic et al. (2009) showed, about predation by Red Foxes, that Dusky Hopping-mouse abundance was associated negatively with Red Fox activity.There is competition from House Mice (Mus musculus; minor to moderate, across the entire range): the House Mouse is very common at times in sites where Dusky Hopping-mouse occurs (Moseby et al. 1999, TSSC 2008); although, the effects are not clear.Climate change (minor-moderate in short to medium term, entire range) could represent a major threat: if rainfall reduces or high rainfall events become less frequent and droughts more frequent, the species may decline or disappear.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Areas at high risk include the southeastern Ituri Forest, the Kisangani area, Rubi-Tele, and the western and eastern limits of the species' range in the Ebola River basin and Virunga-Hoyo region respectively.Hunting for meat and skins is also a threat and Okapi decline rapidly in areas where there is persistent use of snares. In some areas, Okapi are targeted for bushmeat whereas in others they are taken only incidentally (Hart 2013, Kümpel et al. 2015).The most prominent current threat to Okapi is the presence of illegal armed groups in and around key protected areas. These groups prevent effective conservation action, even surveys and monitoring in most sites, and engage in and facilitate elephant poaching, bushmeat hunting, illegal mining (gold, coltan and diamonds), illegal logging, charcoal production and agricultural encroachment. In a notorious incident in June 2012, armed rebels attacked the RFO HQ and killed seven people and all 14 captive Okapi.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Bonobos reproduce slowly, and thus their populations are particularly susceptible to direct losses caused by humans. Poaching: despite the fact that all killing, capture or consumption of great apes is illegal, poaching is the most direct and immediate threat to great apes in DRC. Although taboos against hunting Bonobos still exist in some regions, these taboos have become ineffective where poachers are not local. In other locations, transient and immigrant human populations with different cultural values have increased the frequency of hunting and eating of Bonobos. Poachers prefer large mammals, and since Bonobos are the largest primate in the region, they may be targeted along with ungulates and monkeys. Commercial poachers, aided by military and local administrations, are active even in legally-protected sites, such as Salonga National Park (SNP), Lomako-Yokokala Faunal Reserve, Tumba-Lediima Natural Reserve, Sankuru Natural Reserve, and the proposed Lomami National Park. The importance of these protected areas as significant reservoirs of Bonobos will be compromised rapidly if current levels of poaching continue. Between 2003 and 2006, Hart et al. (2008) recorded evidence of poaching in 51% of survey grids across SNP, with hunting pressure highest in the north and east. However, since then, investment in effective antipoaching measures appears to have protected at least the Lokofa Sector in the southern block of SNP, where Bonobo abundance remained stable between 2006 and 2015 (WCS 2015). Extrapolating from interview data gathered for a bushmeat survey conducted in the Lomami National Park (LNP) area in 2008, it was estimated that 270 Bonobos per year were consumed around Kindu, representing three Bonobos per 100 km² per year in the area investigated (Mirambo et al. 2014). Currently, this negative trend has been halted within the park through surveillance and collaboration with local communities (Hart and Hart 2011, 2015). The intake rate of orphaned Bonobos into the Lola ya Bonobo sanctuary may be viewed as another indicator of hunting pressure and/or anti-trafficking efforts. Hughes et al. (2011) estimated that 4.2 Chimpanzees (2.6–8.9 individuals) are removed from the wild whenever a single live infant is obtained as a by-product of a hunt. Considering that Bonobos are more social than Chimpanzees, the ratio of dead Bonobos per orphaned infant may be higher. Data compiled between 1994 and 2012 show a small but steady increase in the number of orphans entering the sanctuary, with two peaks each of six infants in 1997 and 2000 during the Congolese wars, and a peak of 16 individuals in 2004 after the implementation of peace and return to the regular use of rivers as major transport routes (ABC 2012). An influx of nine Bonobos in 2012 was also notably high, but arrivals decreased to two in 2015. While various explanations for lower intakes are possible (e.g., decline of Bonobos in the wild, or effective anti-poaching and anti-trafficking measures, or Bonobos being exported illegally), it is important to remember that the variation in such small numbers may be stochastic, rather than a real trend.Habitat loss: subsistence agriculture, commercial agriculture, logging and road construction all cause forest loss and fragmentation that reduces the usable (or ‘effective’) habitat available to Bonobos. Moreover, civil strife has been shown to exacerbate destruction and degradation of Bonobo habitat: in Luo Scientific Reserve and Iyondji Community Bonobo Reserve, primary forest loss in previously unfragmented core forests was over two times greater during a decade when conflict and war were predominant in the region (1990–2000) than during a relatively conflict-free period (2000–2010), when humans left their hiding in core forest areas and returned to their natal villages and farms within long-established agricultural complexes (Nackoney et al. 2014). However, as conflict recedes, large-scale commerce is expanding and industrial agriculture is likely to become a significant driver of forest loss. Oil palm is already being grown in what would otherwise be Bonobo habitat (Nackoney et al. 2012), and Africa is becoming the new frontier for oil-palm plantations, which offers excellent economic prospects in countries with appropriate rainfall, soil and temperature conditions (Rival and Levang 2014). A staggering 99.2% of the Bonobo’s range is suitable for oil palm (Wich et al. 2014), highlighting the enormous risk the palm-oil industry will pose unless sustainable management plans are developed and implemented to protect great apes and their habitats (IUCN SSC Primate Specialist Group 2014). It is worth noting that even though permits for prospection or resource extraction have already been granted, drilling for petroleum is unlikely to recommence in the near future, given the low price of crude oil on the international market. Although logging and mining do not yet occur on a large scale in Bonobo habitat, industrial extraction could become a serious threat in future. Minimising the conversion of intact forest in DRC to human-dominated land uses, will be critical for the survival of Bonobos, particularly when considering DRC’s high human population growth rate (2.45% in 2015; CIA 2015).Disease: infectious diseases are of particular concern in areas where Bonobos live in close proximity to human communities, or have been habituated to human observers for research or tourism purposes (Gilardi et al. 2015). Diseases that pose a risk to Bonobos include human-borne pathogens such as respiratory viruses, and natural pathogens such as Ebolavirus. Respiratory disease outbreaks were observed among Bonobos at Wamba when displaced people and soldiers were moving through the forest (Sakamaki et al. 2009), and human respiratory syncytial virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae co-infection has been detected at Malebo, where Bonobo habitat is surrounded by a particularly high human density (Leendertz pers. comm.). In 2014, a human outbreak of Ebola virus disease occurred in the Bonobo’s range. Considering their highly cohesive social structure, and high rates of physical contact, an Ebolavirus outbreak could devastate a Bonobo community. Despite a lack of scientific investigation of disease in wild Bonobos, these cases highlight the increasing need for health monitoring and disease contingency plans, as recommended by Gilardi et al. (2015).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Until about 2005, Cozumel was still relatively well-conserved, with close to 90% of the island covered by natural vegetation (Romero-Nájera 2004, Romero-Nájera et al. 2007), but the situation is deteriorating  rapidly. The interior of the island is less developed, but Pygmy Raccoon is rare or absent there (Cuarón et al. 2004, García-Vasco 2005, Copa-Alvaro 2007).  There is only a very small area of prime raccoon habitat and this is on the coast where most of the tourist development is taking place.The expansion and widening of the road system is fragmenting the vegetation of the island in at least three areas (Cuarón et al. 2004, de Villa-Meza et al. 2011). The widening of roads is potentially increasing their barrier effect and exacerbating their impact on the conservation of Pygmy Raccoon and other native species (de Villa-Meza et al. 2011). Most cases of Pygmy Raccoon mortality documented since 2001 have been the result of animals being run over by cars on the island's highways (García-Vasco 2005).Alien invasive predators, such as the snake Boa constrictor, as well as domestic and feral dogs, may have an important impact on the Pygmy Raccoon population and it is confirmed that feral dogs predate them (Martínez-Morales and Cuarón 1999, García-Vasco 2005, Bautista 2006).  Additionally, introduced carnivores to the island could easily become a source of parasites and pathogens that could potentially affect negatively Pygmy Raccoon populations (Cuarón et al. 2004, McFadden et al. 2005, Mena 2007).  The introduction of the closely related Northern Raccoon P. lotor (there are frequent vehicle ferries between the island and mainland), usually for pets, is a risk of genetic introgression and a potential source of parasites and pathogens (Cuarón et al. 2004).Hurricanes are the main natural threat recognized for the Cozumel biota (Cuarón et al. 2004, Perdomo 2006, Barillas 2007, Copa-Alvaro 2007).  For Pygmy Raccoon, hurricanes cause drastic population decline, reduction in the proportion of juveniles, direct injury, and facilitate pathological change (Copa-Alvaro 2007, Mena 2007). The frequency, magnitude and duration of hurricanes in the Caribbean Basin is increasing (Goldenberg et al. 2001), so they are an issue of major concern because there may be a synergistic effect with anthropogenic disturbance.Hunting and collection of Pygmy Raccoons as pets is currently not an important threat.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Illegal hunting (in addition to the legal harvest) is an increasing threat and male-biased hunting before and during the rut could have serious consequences for the fecundity of the population (Lhagvasuren and Milner-Gulland 1997).The Ulaanbaatar-Beijing railway is double-fenced and has effectively cut off the smaller western populations from the core population in eastern Mongolia (Ito et al. 2005), although the large population and high mobility of the species has allowed sufficient gene flow (Okada et al. 2015). Outbreaks of disease and severe winters result in sporadic heavy mortality. Increasing livestock numbers has led to an increase in associated disease transmission (e.g. bacterial pneumonia caused by Pasteurella, viral influenza, foot-and-mouth, and anthrax) (Lhagvasuren and Milner-Gulland 1997, Schaller and Lhagvasuren 1998, Nyamsuren et al. 2006). The distribution of Mongolian Gazelle is influenced by the activity of the vole Lasiopodomys brandtii. For example, in the 1990s a large increase in the L. brandtii population destroyed a huge area of pasture in Sukhbaatar and Dornod provinces and the gazelles disappeared from these areas and moved north (Lhagvasuren and Milner-Gulland 1997).",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Although the Olive Colobus can live in disturbed forests, even secondary forest is being replaced by farms and plantations in many parts of West Africa, and other species of monkey with which the Olive Colobus typically associates are being eliminated by hunting. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are among three of 10 countries in the world that had the fastest annual acceleration of tree cover loss in the 2001–2014 period, based on an analysis of satellite imagery, with Sierra Leone (once a stronghold for this species) recording the world’s second greatest annual forest loss rate of 12.6% (Petersen et al. 2015). In Nigeria, in the most easterly part of the species range, P. verus can be considered Endangered as a consequence of heavy hunting pressure and escalating habitat loss (R. Ikemeh pers. comm. 2016); data from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization show a 5% per annum loss of forest cover in Nigeria in the 2010–2015 period compared with 2.7% per annum in 1990–2000 (FAO 2015). The same data analysis (FAO 2015) shows that in the eight countries in which Olive Colobus populations have been found (Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Togo) there was a combined total forest loss in the 1990–2015 period of 22.5%. A separate analysis by the U.S. Geological Survey’s EROS Centre shows a total forest loss in the Upper Guinea region (excluding Benin and Nigeria) of 25% between 1975 and 2013 (CILSS 2016). Given the continuation of uncontrolled hunting of monkeys across much of this species’ range, it is suspected that P. verus has suffered a population reduction of at least 30% in the last three generations, and that this decline will accelerate in the future.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The major threat across its South Asian range appears to be habitat loss and fragmentation by developmental activities such as urbanization, industrialization, agriculture and aquaculture (prawn and shrimp farms), whereas in Southeast Asia persecution is the major threat (Melisch et al. 1996, Cutter and Cutter 2009, Tantipisanuh et al. 2014, Willcox et al. 2014). Outside Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, Thailand, Cutter (2015) reported 84% mortality of radio-collared Fishing Cats during the study period. Of 16 Fishing Cats that were radio-collared, three could not be located and could have either dispersed or died. Of the remaining 13, only two survived the almost three-year study period while five were poached and six died of unknown causes. Five dead cats were located. In one case the poacher who shot an animal reported the cause of death when he returned its ear tag.  In India, much of its habitat comprises freshwater marshlands which are categorised as ‘wastelands’ under land use policies and are thus subject to conversion and degradation (Adhya 2015). Linked to this is conflict with humans, which is believed to be aggravated by habitat fragmentation and sharing of resources such as space (wetlands) and food (fish, goats, poultry) (Melisch et al. 1996, Kolipaka 2006, Cutter and Cutter 2009, Mukherjee et al. 2012, Chowdhury et al. 2015). Poisoning, trapping and clubbing seem to be common methods to kill Fishing Cats across the species’ range. A survey in West Bengal recorded 27 deaths of Fishing Cats between April 2010 and May 2011 in that year in the Howrah district (1,600 km²) (Mukherjee et al. 2012). In Bangladesh, a compilation of reports from newspaper articles and web-based searches on the Fishing Cat (deaths, captures, rescues and releases) revealed 82 records and 30 confirmed deaths over a three-year period from January 2010 to March 2013 (Chowdhury et al. 2015). In both areas, almost all deaths could be traced to local people killing the cats (Mukherjee et al. 2012, Chowdhury et al. 2015). It should be taken as the minimum number killed because not all instances are recorded. In the Sundarbans of India, local people from Sagar Island admitted to having exterminated the cat from their island (Mukherjee et al. 2012). Chowdhury et al. (2015) noted that in Bangladesh and India more than 70% of the deaths occurred during the dry season, perhaps when Fishing Cat and human resources overlap maximally. A recent study (Adhya 2015) in the Howrah district of West Bengal reveals that Fishing Cat diet is largely composed of small mammals, fish and birds with a negligible portion (less than 5%) comprising of livestock and surmises that the killings are based on a perception of conflict because of the presence of the cat.In Cambodia the Fishing Cat is killed by locals for consumption or in retaliation for damaging fishing nets (Thaung and Herranz Muñoz 2016). Such killings probably occur throughout its Southeast Asian range.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

These result in modification and destruction of riparian habitat, overfishing, contamination of aquatic ecosystems (especially due to gold mining, fossil fuel exploration, and the use of pesticides and fertilizers for monocultures), domestic animal diseases, and mismanaged tourism (Duplaix 1980, Groenendijk 1998, Schenck 1999, Utreras 2001, Utreras and Tirira 2011).Gold mining, artisanal as well as industrial, is a significant threat to the species, particularly in the Guiana Shield region (Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana, Venezuela and northern Brazil) and in southeastern Peru. Its main impacts are habitat destruction, sedimentation of rivers, and pollution (Mongabay.com). Gold miners cut swathes into the floodplain forest and blast river banks with pressure hoses, using mercury to amalgamate gold particles. Gold prices are at a record high - now approaching US$1,800/oz. - and mercury is cheap. Peruvian mercury imports have risen 42% (2006-2009) to 130 t/yr, almost all of which is used directly in artisanal gold mining. Forest conversion to mining increased six-fold from 2003-2006 (292 ha/yr) to 2006-2009 (1,915 ha/yr) (Swenson et al. 2011).Areas impacted by gold-mining have been shown to still have depleted fish populations and to not have been re-colonized by otters over a decade after mining stopped. In areas of gold mining, fish are contaminated with mercury. Gutleb et al. (1997) found that mercury concentrations in the majority of fish in the area of Manu National Park were higher than what is considered tolerable in the Eurasian Otter. However, the expected high concentrations of methylmercury in Giant Otter tissues have not been corroborated due to the difficulty of finding dead Giant Otters. Migration of contaminated fish and long-range atmospheric transport of mercury probably increase the miner’s area of influence.One of the major future threats are the many planned hydroelectric dams within the region; these will change habitats and alter hydrological regimes of rivers downstream with resulting impacts on fish populations and habitat. There are plans for 151 new dams greater than two MW over the next 20 years (the time-span considered for this assessment is 24 years), more than a 300% increase. These dams would include five of the six major Andean tributaries of the Amazon. Ecological impact analysis classified 47% of the potential new dams as high impact and just 19% as low impact. Sixty per cent of the dams would cause the first major break in connectivity between protected Andean headwaters and the lowland Amazon. More than 80% would drive deforestation due to new roads, transmission lines, or inundation (Finer and Jenkins 2012). Giant Otters are able to live in some artificial lakes such as the shallow Balbina Lake (Rosas et al. 2007 but the population level impact of these projects is unknown. Other major infrastructure projects include the Inter-oceanic highway in southeastern Peru, and the Initiative for the Integration of the Regional Infrastructure of South America (IIRSA) (V. Utreras pers. comm. 2012).Molecular research suggests that the Giant Otter populations of the Madre de Dios drainage have a distinct evolutionary history and consequently represents an evolutionary unit, an important segment of the species’ total genetic diversity (Pickles et al. 2011). The current and projected high level of threat facing this population together with its intrinsic importance in safeguarding the evolutionary potential of the species make it of high conservation concern.Giant Otters are vulnerable to disturbance from poorly managed tourism, including sport fishing. With increasing tourism in South America it has proved important to control tourism on lakes and rivers both in and outside protected areas (Schenck and Staib 2000, Groenendijk and Hajek 2006). Monitoring of Giant Otter and tourist groups before and after implementation of management zoning has shown that Giant Otter reproductive success and sighting success by tourists on unmanaged lakes is considerably lower than on managed lakes (Groenendijk and Hajek 2006).Giant Otter cubs held in captivity have died of canine parvovirus and all mustelids are susceptible to canine distemper, so domestic animal diseases could pose a serious threat to wild giant otter populations. Infection could also occur in remote areas since transient otters and people hunting with dogs travel large distances with potential for contact and infection of immunologically naive populations (Schenck et al. 1997).Human/Giant Otter conflict is emerging as an increasingly important problem. Otters may be killed for fun or out of fear, or, more often, because they are seen as competitors for fish by loggers, miners, and fishermen who often blame them for depleting fish resources used for local consumption and in commercial and sport fishing (Gómez and Jorgensen 1999, Recharte et al. 2008, Rosas-Ribeiro et al. 2011, Utreras and Tirira 2011). Additionally, Giant Otters are sometimes blamed for damage to fishing nets and traps (Rosas-Ribeiro et al. 2011). Fish-farming is rapidly increasing within the species’ range and may prove to be a source of conflict and habitat degradation in the future. Giant Otters occasionally become trapped in fishing nets and drown. Cubs are sometimes captured illegally to keep as pets.Giant Otters are highly susceptible to persecution: they are large, easily visible, very social, and vocal. They are diurnal and occupy open habitats and stable territories. Their sign – latrines and dens - is easily recognizable and often visible, making it possible to identify areas of recent activity by a group (Groenendijk et al. 2005). Individuals and groups often react to people by approaching to investigate. Moreover, only the dominant pair produces young, and usually only once a year. During the years of the pelt trade, these life history attributes of the species combined to make it extremely vulnerable, and today may cause it to be an easy target for fishermen as was documented recently on two different rivers in southeastern Peru (R. Williams pers. comm. 2012), and in the Sustainable Development Reserve Uacari, in Brazil (Rosas-Ribeiro et al. 2011) where 21 Giant Otters were killed over an undefined period between 2006 and 2006 (M. Marmontel and Lima pers. comms.). In 2011-2012, the Kanamari indigenous people promoted a massive Giant Otter killing in their territory (Território Indigena Kanamari, adjacent to the SDR Uacari), based on their perception that the species is overfishing the river turtle population. The community leader bought 300 cartridges and distributed these amongst other hunters; 64 Giant Otters were shot (Endo pers. comm. 2012). Such incidents of targeted killing can contribute significantly to the extinction of small subpopulations in a watershed.It seems likely that mining activities and the widespread conversion of forest into agricultural and pasture lands will continue unabated in the near future as part of the economic development of the Amazonian countries. Brazil, which represents roughly three quarters of the Giant Otter’s current distribution range, merits greater consideration. As stated earlier, Giant Otter populations of the Pantanal appear to be recovering, with signs of reaching carrying capacity in some areas (Ribas et al. 2012). Populations are stable and possibly recovering in some parts of the Amazon (Rosas et al. 2008). However, the human population is increasing and expanding simultaneously and the Amazon region registered the highest population growth of the whole country in the last census (IBGE 2010). As a consequence, we can expect colonization of new regions, intensive exploitation of natural resources, destruction of forests, reduction of water quality, and overfishing. Furthermore, the proposed mega-projects included in the Growth Acceleration Plan (PAC) as well as the recently approved federal law, represent a significant threat to Amazonian diversity.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

Sport hunting became common in the late 1800s and early 1900s. A reversal of government policies shortly thereafter protected many of the remaining populations. However, poaching, mainly for the use of the horn in Traditional Asian Medicine, has remained a constant threat and the success is precarious without continued support for conservation efforts in India and Nepal. Past poaching led to declines in several important populations, especially those in Chitwan, Manas, Laokhowa, and the Babai Valley area of Bardia, but in the past 5 years, poaching has decreased and the populations in these areas are increasing (except for Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary).However, not all recent population decreases can be linked to poaching. There have been serious declines in quality of habitat in some areas. This is due to: 1) severe invasion by alien plants into grasslands affecting some populations; 2) demonstrated reductions in the extent of grasslands and wetland habitats due to woodland encroachment and silting up of beels; and 3) grazing by domestic livestock. In Chitwan National Park (the second largest population), poaching alone does not account for the observed level of population decline (R.H. Emslie pers. comm.), and there are trends in a number of reproductive indicators (i.e., decline in the percentage of adult females calving and in the percentage of the population that is calves) that are strongly indicative of negative changes in habitat quality. In Chitwan, there has been severe infestation of some riverine and grassland areas by the climbing Mikania micrantha (which covers over indigenous vegetation), and invasion of Eupatorium in other areas (Murphy, et al., 2013). There is also heavy livestock grazing pressure and disturbance in buffer zone areas as well as some invasion of grasslands by Acacia catechu and Dalbergia sissou. In India, there is not yet any evidence that invasion by alien plants has caused any population decreases. However, in Orang National Park, there have been marked habitat changes due to grazing, human encroachment and silting up. In particular, short grass areas have declined by 75% due to silting up and draining of beels, lake-like wetlands with static water (B.N. Talukdar, pers. comm.). Mimosa is also an alien invader in this area. In the Karnali floodplain area of Bardia there is also some invasion of habitat by the alien Lantana camara. In Pabitora, there has been an invasion of Ipomoea spp. ""weeds"" and Parthenium spp. into grassland areas (S. Dutta, pers. comm.). There also has been an invasion of woodland into grassland and siltation and drying up of some water bodies. There also has been some human encroachment and very heavy livestock grazing. With increasing human densities this pressure is unlikely to get any less (S. Dutta pers. comm.). Analysis of satellite imagery has shown that there has a substantial increase in woodland (34.51%) in Pabitora since 1977 accompanied by decline in alluvial grassland (68%) (Sarma et al. 2009). This change of habitat is mostly because of natural succession process, livestock grazing from the nearby villages as well as improper management of the grassland habitat (Sarma et al. 2009). The West Bengal populations (Jaldapara and Gorumara) are affected by high levels of grazing from fringe villages, and there have been weed and climber infestations by Mikania cordata, M. scandens, Lantana camara, Christella dentata, and Leea spp.  The species is inherently at risk because over 70% of its population occurs at a single site, Kaziranga National Park. This area, is subject to poaching and tensions with the surrounding high human population due to human-wildlife conflicts (including conflicts with rhinos). The level of poaching in Kaziranga has generally not been at a level to prevent the ongoing increase in the population, but constant vigilance is required. At least 12 rhinos were lost in the July 2019 monsoon floods, and numerous calves were rescued. Any severe catastrophic event in Kaziranga (such as disease, civil disorder, poaching, habitat loss, etc.) would have a devastating impact on the species.During surveys carried out in February 2019, Jaldapara and Gorumara reported figures of 231 and 52 rhinos respectively - the highest numbers recorded during the last 100 years. There are suggestions that the two protected areas have reached their carrying capacities and suitable areas need to be found for the West Bengal populations. A male:female:unknown sex ratio of 3.8.1 has been reported in the Gorumara population based on dung DNA analysis (Borkathur, et al. 2016). As a result, fights among bulls are very common and these animals often stray out of the National Park, leading to human-wildlife conflicts (S. S. Bist, pers. comm).There are suggestions that the small population of rhinos in Jaldapara and Gorumara may be prone to inbreeding depression (S.S. Bist, pers. comm.).There have been proposals to dam the Bramaphutra River in Arunachal Pradesh, and should this happen in future things could very negatively affect the habitat quality and rhino carrying capacity of major parks like Kaziranga in future (by preventing or reducing the pulse of nutrients brought in by regular large floods). In Jaldapara National Park, the River Torsa no longer overflows as a result of massive flood-control structures. As a result the water table in Jaldapara National Park is receding and the natural water-bodies and wallow-pools used by rhinos are slowly drying up (S.S.

In many marsh habitats, there is no higher ground to escape to during high tides. Habitat within the range of the southern subspecies (R. r. raviventris) has been more severely impacted than that of the northern subspecies (R. r. halicoetes).Most of the historical tidal marsh habitat has been lost as a result of filling for urban development and conversion to agricultural uses and commercial salt production. Upland vegetative cover adjoining tidal marshes is important cover for harvest mice during high tides and storms, but much of this habitat is no longer available due to clearing and conversion to intensive human uses. Remaining populations are relatively small, isolated, and may lack the size and full range of resources needed for long-term persistence.Threats include continued loss of habitat to development, pollution and other changes in water quality, and encroachment by exotic plant species (e.g., invasive cordgrasses, Spartina) that do not provide suitable habitat for salt marsh harvest mice. Most areas of remaining habitat support few to no mice because of backfilling, subsidence, or vegetation changes. Salt marshes are subject to subsidence and increased tidal coverage (flooding) as a result of groundwater pumping. This reduces the extent of the broad pickleweed zone favoured by harvest mice (Shellhammer 1998).Most of the remaining habitat is diked. Much of the habitat is managed for waterfowl and such management (e.g., lowered salinities) may not be compatible with the needs of harvest mice. Excessive inputs of fresh water (e.g., from discharges of treated municipal sewage) have altered salinity levels, marsh vegetation, and mouse food resources. See Shellhammer (1989) for a discussion of threats to diked marshes.Much of the East Bay shoreline from San Leandro to Calaveras Point is rapidly eroding. In addition, an estimated 600 acres of former salt marsh along Coyote Creek, Alviso Slough, and Guadalupe Slough has been converted to fresh- and brackish-water vegetation due to freshwater discharge from South Bay wastewater facilities; these areas likely no longer support populations of salt marsh harvest mice.Some habitat has been lost as a result of discing of non-tidal salt marsh. Discing of wetlands, an activity not regulated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, has been employed by interests seeking to obscure the Corps' jurisdiction and circumvent the Clean Water Act and the Federal Endangered Species Act.Some harvest mice are preyed upon by feral and free-ranging cats and non-native red foxes that roam salt-pond dikes or wander from residential areas now bordering many tidal marshes.Habitat may be threatened over the long term by the rise in sea level that is predicted to occur within the next century. In combination with reduced sediment supply caused by upstream dams and water diversions, sea level rise could result in major losses of tidal marsh habitat that would be very difficult to prevent or mitigate.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Individuals will often vacate a roost following a disturbance, and the default assumption is that roost abandonment leads to higher rates of mortality because alternative suboptimal roosts nearby are less likely to provide suitable microclimates. Large numbers have also been killed by inappropriate cave gating in the past. A significant proportion of museum specimens originated as road kill, owing to their relatively low foraging height and curiosity for lights, which indicates that new roads close to roosts have the potential to deplete local colonies. The greatest threat to the species is the loss of roost sites that now serve as strongholds for a large proportion of the known population through the gradual deterioration and flooding of old mines and the possibility of catastrophic losses from sudden collapses (Armstrong 2001; Woinarski et al. 2014). The growing encroachment of iron ore mining also has the potential to remove roosts and thus area of occupancy in terrains where the species roosts in natural caves. Threats to roosting colonies appear to be of lower risk in the Kimberley and Northern Territory, but there is still the potential for catastrophic loss of large numbers if known important colonies are not managed effectively. While R. aurantia has a generalist diet and appears to use a range of habitats for foraging, widespread degradation of habitat quality around a roost, such as from poor fire management, might reduce colony survivability or place a limit on its size.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Lowland forest below 500 m is one of the most threatened habitats in Madagascar. Deforestation and forest disturbance has increased significantly since 2009. R. Rajaonson (pers. comm. 2014) estimated that deforestation in eastern forest increased from 0.5% per annum in 2005-2010 to 0.94% per annum in 2010-2013. Allnut et al. (2009) estimated that in Masoala National Park, annual rates of deforestation in the studied area increased to 1.27% per annum in 2011. High levels of illegal settlement in protected areas, especially around the Bay of Antongil, are linked to artisanal mining (for quartz) and logging of rosewood; hunting for food using dogs has increased greatly in these areas as a result. Some villages have seen increases in populations of between 200 and 300% (C. Golden pers. comm. 2014).In the Makira region there are no data on consumption rates of this carnivore, which is likely to reflect its overall rarity (Farris et al. in review a). In Betampona Strict Nature Reserve, Golden et al. (in press) reported six Brown-tailed Vontsiras hunted in one year, potentially a large proportion of the population of this very small site (2,228 ha).Household interviews conducted by Madagasikara Voakajy (pers. comm. 2014) in the Moramanga region of eastern Madagascar in 2008-2009 did not identify Brown-tailed Vontsira as a hunted animal, which again might simply reflect its overall rarity.Brown-tailed Vontsira had very strong temporal activity overlap with dogs and moderate overlap with feral/wild cats, revealing the potential for increased interactions and competition.

This implies that perhaps as little as 9% of the original habitat of the island remains in good condition. Therefore it seems likely that, while we know little about this species, habitat loss through slash and burn activities is a major threat. On the other hand, it is not clear that “good” habitat is also compatible with the needs of tarsier conservation. All species of tarsiers that have been studied in the wild are recorded in a number of non-forest habitats, but it remains an open question as to whether these habitats are suitable for sustainably-reproducing populations. GIS also provides an estimate of 1,474 km2 of “fair” habitat remaining on Pulau Peleng. Together with “good” habitat, this yields a total of 1,685 km2 of habitat that is potentially suitable for tarsier conservation, a figure that represents slightly more than 72% of the island’s total area. In other words, the estimate of the percentage of the original tarsier habitat that still remains on Pulau Peleng varies from 9 to 72%, depending on whether “fair” habitat is included in the model. This example illustrates the need for field surveys to determine the suitability of “fair” habitat for sustainable tarsier populations. In the meantime, we use a most conservative estimate that includes good habitat only.First-hand reports of conditions on Pulau Peleng are scant, but by analogy with other areas of Sulawesi, it should likely expect a continuing pattern of encroachment into tarsier habitat, leading to a decrease in the area of occupancy, quality of habitat, number of tarsier populations and mature individuals (M. Shekelle pers. comm.). Other threats may include illegal logging, agricultural pesticides, and predation by domestic animals (dogs and cats).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Higher ambient temperatures and erratic weather fluctuations, symptoms of anthropogenic climate change, are increasing across the range of polar bears. Polar Bears are dependent upon Arctic sea ice for access to their prey. Their dependence on an ephemeral habitat that exists as a function of sea surface and atmospheric temperatures means that climate warming poses the single most important threat to the long-term persistence of Polar Bears (Obbard et al. 2010). Arctic sea ice loss has thus far progressed faster than most climate models have predicted (Stroeve et al. 2007) with September sea extent declining at a linear rate of 14% per decade from 1979 through 2011 (Stroeve et al. 2012, Stroeve et al. 2014). Because changes in sea-ice are known to alter Polar Bear abundance, productivity, body condition, and distribution (Stirling et al. 1999, Fischbach et al. 2007, Schleibe et al. 2008, Durner et al. 2009, Regehr et al. 2010, Rode et al. 2010a, 2012, 2014b, Bromaghin et al. 2015), continued climate warming will increase future uncertainty and pose severe risks to the welfare of Polar Bear subpopulations (Stirling and Derocher 2012, Derocher et al. 2013). Arctic sea ice extent is linearly related to global mean temperature, which in turn, is directly related to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (Amstrup et al. 2010). Population and habitat models predict substantial declines in the distribution and abundance of Polar Bears in the future (Durner et al. 2009, Amstrup et al. 2008, Hunter et al. 2010, Castro de la Guardia et al. 2013, Hamilton et al. 2014). Although Polar Bears living in historically colder regions of the Arctic might derive transient benefit from a climate-driven transition away from multi-year ice (Derocher et al. 2004), the annual sea ice must persist long enough for Polar Bears to derive benefit from associated changes in seal availability and biological productivity. Recent sea ice simulations suggest large regions of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago will be ice free for >5 months by the late 21st century (Hamilton et al. 2014). In other parts of the Arctic, the 5-month ice-free threshold may be reached by the middle of the 21st century (Atwood et al. 2015). These studies are based on sea-ice data obtained from the World Climate Research Programme's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) (http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/). An annual ice-free period of ≥5 months is likely to lead to extended fasting, which is predicted to lead to increased reproductive failure and starvation (Molnár et al. 2011, 2014a, Robbins et al. 2012b). Nevertheless, uncertainty and regional variability in the near-term effects of climate change must be included in Polar Bear management and conservation plans.Although there have been local and regional studies on polar bear denning habitat (Kolenosky and Prevett 1983, Messier et al. 1994, Lunn et al. 2004, Richardson et al. 2005, Durner et al. 2003, 2006, 2013, Andersen et al. 2012), large scale mapping of Polar Bear denning habitat across the Arctic has not occurred. It is also unknown how climate change will change denning locations and habitats, though predicted increases in forest fires may have adverse effects on maternity denning habitat in sub-Arctic regions (Richardson et al. 2007). Declining sea ice availability can impair the ability of pregnant females to reach traditional denning areas (Derocher et al. 2011, Cherry et al. 2013) and increases of rain events will be detrimental for denning Polar Bears (Stirling and Derocher 1993, Derocher et al. 2004).The occurrence of diseases and parasites in Polar Bears is rare compared with occurrences in other ursids. However, with warming Arctic temperatures, altered climate could influence  infectious disease epidemiology through mechanisms such as novel pathogen introduction due to range expansion of carrier animals and arthropod vectors; modification of host susceptibility; changes in pathogen evolution, transmission, and number of generations per year; host immunosuppression; shifts in main food sources; altered behaviour; and co-infections with multiple agents (Harvell et al. 2002, Parmesan 2006, Burek et al. 2008, Hueffer et al. 2011). As a result, the potential for exposure to pathogens and resulting disease outbreaks may become more significant threats as Polar Bears experience the cumulative effects of multiple stressors (Patyk et al. 2015).The warming climate has been associated with an increase in pathogens in other Arctic marine and terrestrial organisms. Parasitic agents that have developmental stages outside the bodies of warm-blooded hosts (e.g., nematodes: Laaksonen et al. 2010) will likely benefit from the warmer and wetter weather projected for the Arctic. Improved conditions for such parasites have already adversely affected the health of some Arctic mammals (Kutz et al. 2013). Bacterial parasites also are likely to benefit from a warmer and wetter Arctic (e.g., Vibrio parahaemolyticus; Baker-Austin et al. 2012). As the effects of climate change become more prevalent, there is concern about the emergence of new pathogens within polar bear range, new threats from existing pathogens that may be able to infect immuno-compromised/stressed bears, and the potential for new and existing pathogens to cross human–animal boundaries (e.g., giardia). Because of the previous limited exposure of Polar Bears to diseases and parasites (Fagre et al. 2015), researchers have as yet been unable to determine whether they will be more susceptible to new pathogens. However, concern is exacerbated by the fact that Polar Bears appear to have a naïve immune system (Weber et al. 2013), which may make them particularly vulnerable to infection. Many different pathogens have been found in seal species that are Polar Bear prey; the potential therefore exists for transmission of these diseases to Polar Bears (Kirk et al. 2010). If Polar Bears become nutritionally stressed, altered foraging behaviours such as increased feeding on the internal organs of their primary prey and use of alternative foods (e.g., Prop et al. 2015) may increase the potential for exposure to pathogens. Ensuring the long-term persistence of Polar Bears will necessitate understanding how a rapidly changing physical environment modulates exposure to disease risk factors and, ultimately, population health.Persistent organic pollutants, which reach Arctic regions via long range transport by air and ocean currents as well as river run off, also increase uncertainty for the welfare of polar bears (Obbard et al. 2010, www.pbsg.npolar.no). Although Polar Bears live in relatively pristine Arctic regions, a variety of industrial toxic substances are brought into Polar Bear management areas from human anthropogenic activities around the world. Polar Bears are apex predators and are therefore exposed to high levels of pollutants, which magnify with each step in the food web resulting in high concentrations in polar bear tissue (Letcher et al. 2010). A key characteristic of these pollutants is that they persist in the environment due to low biotic and abiotic degradation. The contaminant burdens among Polar Bears are known to vary among regions (e.g., Letcher et al. 2010, McKinney et al. 2011). Even where contaminant burdens may be known, their effects on Polar Bear physiol­ogy and health are not well understood (Letcher et al. 2010, Sonne et al. 2012). However, Dietz et al. (2015) showed that the risk for reproductive, immune suppressive and carcinogenic effects in polar bear subpopulations across the Arctic are high due to PCB and perflourinated compounds (PFCs) exposure.Many of the contaminants are lipophilic and bond tightly to lipophilic tissues. Polar Bears are particularly vulnerable to organochlorines because they eat a fat rich diet. Ringed, bearded, and harp seals comprise the main food of Polar Bears and the blubber layer is preferentially eaten by the bears and subsequently, the intake of pollutants is high (Letcher et al. 2010). Recent studies have documented new pollutants in polar bear tissues which expose the species to even more toxic and complex combination of industrial chemicals (Verreault et al. 2005, 2006; Muir et al. 2006; Smithwick et al. 2006; McKinney et al. 2009, 2011; Gebbink et al. submitted). The potential for contam­inants to impact Arctic systems is predicted to increase as climate warming alters global circulation and precipitation patterns (Macdonald et al. 2005, Jenssen et al. 2015) and predicting local and regional effects will become more complicated and uncertain.A three decade study (1983-2010) of East Greenland Polar Bears revealed both declines of conventional POPs and increases in brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and PFCs (Dietz et al. 2008, 2013a,b; Riget et al. 2013). The last decade has showed climate related increases in PCBs as well as peaks of BFRs and PFCs due to recent industrial reductions (Dietz et al. 2013b McKinney et al. 2013).Although the effects of pollutants on polar bears are only partially understood, levels of such pollutants in some subpopulations are already sufficiently high that they may interfere with hormone regulation, immune system function, and possibly reproduction (Wiig et al. 1998; Bernhoft et al. 2000; Skaare et al. 2000, 2001; Gustavson et al. 2015; Henriksen et al. 2001; Derocher et al. 2003; Derocher 2005; Dietz et al. 2015; Sonne et al. 2015). There are suggestions that species with delayed implantation are more vulnerable to the effects of pollution through endocrine (hormone) disruption (Knott et al. 2011). Further, because female Polar Bears are food deprived during gestation, their pollution load increases in their blood, when energy and pollutants are mobilized from their adipose tissue. Because the cubs are nursed on fat rich milk they are exposed to very high pollution loads from their mother (Polishuk et al. 2002, Bytingsvik et al. 2012). This may pose the greatest threat to the species as the vulnerability of pre- and neonatal polar bears is the most sensible to life-long health effects from long-range transported pollution which decreases immunity, survival and reproductive success (Letcher et al. 2010, Sonne 2010).An additional emerging threat to Polar Bears is the increase in resource exploration and development in the Arctic along with increased ice-breaking and shipping. There are currently no data on the effects of ice-breaking on habitat use by Polar Bears. Although some studies suggest that Polar Bears are sensitive to localized disturbance at maternity den sites (Lunn et al. 2004, Durner et al. 2006), our knowledge about potential effects of large scale development is lacking.Oil development in the Arctic poses a wide of range of threats to Polar Bears ranging from oil spills to increased human-bear interactions. It is probable that an oil spill in sea ice habitat would result in oil being concentrated in leads and between ice floes resulting in both Plar Bears and their main prey (Ringed Seal and Bearded Seal) being directly exposed to oil. Polar Bears are often attracted by the smells and sound associated with human activity. Polar Bears are known to ingest plastic, styrofoam, lead acid batteries, tin cans, oil, and other hazardous materials with lethal consequences in some cases (Lunn and Stirling 1985, Amstrup et al. 1989, Derocher and Stirling 1991). Another concern is that seals covered in oil may be a major source of oil to polar bears. Although the biological threats and impacts of oil and gas activities on Polar Bears are reasonably well understood (Øritsland et al. 1981; Hurst and Øritsland 1982; Stirling 1988, 1990; Isaksen et al. 1998; Amstrup et al. 2006), mitigation and response plans are currently lacking (but see Wilson et al. 2014). Moreover, how Polar Bears will be affected by other types of human activity are less well known (Vongraven et al. 2012).Significant portions of the Polar Bear’s range already are being developed and exploration is proposed for many other areas. With warming induced sea ice decline, previously inaccess­ible areas will be exposed to development and other forms of anthropogenic activities (e.g., trans-Arctic shipping, tourism). The direct effects of human activities, the in­creased potential for negative human-bear encounters, and the potential for increased local pollution are all concerns that must be understood if we are to understand and manage impacts on the future for Polar Bears.Our understanding of Polar Bear population dynamics has improved with ongoing development and refinement of analytical methods (e.g., Taylor et al. 1987, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2008a,b, 2009; Amstrup et al. 2001; McDonald and Amstrup 2001; Regehr et al. 2007, 2010, 2015; Aars et al. 2009; Stapleton et al. 2014). These improved and new tools suggest that previous estimates of population parameters and numbers can be biased. Vital rates are subpopulation specific, and different from the generalized rates that were often used to generate previous status reports (Taylor et al. 1987). For the two subpopulations (Southern Beaufort Sea, Western Hudson Bay) that are known to have been impacted by climate change and where a long time series of abundance exist, harvest represents an additive impact. Illegal take of polar bears in Russia, combined with legal subsistence harvest in the U.S., may exceed sustainable limits for the Chukchi subpopulation (pbsg.npolar.no). In many cases harvest documentation and the popula­tion data necessary to assess the impact of harvest both are insufficient to allow managers to provide the desired balance between potential yield and take. Given the cultural and eco­nomic importance of Polar Bear hunting in many regions, understanding the potential for and the impact of hunting continues to be a critical part of management (Obbard et al. 2010, Vongraven et al. 2012, pbsg.npolar.no).It is important that subpopulation estimates and projections are based on substantiated scientific data. In some areas, studies to estimate abundance occur infrequently so if the harvest rate is either initially set above the sustainable level or it becomes so, the subpopulation may be reduced before the next inventory is made. In addition, harvest practices may have to be reconsidered given recent knowledge about long-term environmental trends and fluctuations that can affect sustainable removal rates. In some jurisdictions in Canada, the governance system includes aboriginal co-management boards and aboriginal hunting organizations. In some of these co-management systems, both local knowledge and science are to be considered equally in both management and research decisions. Although scientific studies have concluded that the long-term effects of capturing and collaring polar bears are minimal (Ramsay and Stirling 1986, Messier 2000, Thiemann et al. 2013, Rode et al. 2014a), some local groups nevertheless consider these techniques disrespectful or harmful to the animals. As a result, population inventory and ecological studies have been delayed or not permitted. On the other hand, alternative research techniques such as aerial surveys and genetic biopsy capture-recapture methods were designed and implemented. Reduced monitoring will constrain governments’ ability to assess sustainability of harvest especially if abundance is estimated from aerial surveys which cannot provide data on vital rates (Aars et al. 2009, Stapleton et al. 2014).Human caused habitat change and increasing human-bear interactions also must be incorporated into polar bear population projections (e.g., Hunter et al. 2010) and polar bear harvest management in the future. Due to increased access to pre­viously isolated areas, Polar Bears will face increased risks from a variety of human–bear interactions. New settlements are possible with industrial development, and expansion of tourist visitations is assured. Although the fact of human–bear interactions can be reasonably measured, we have a long way to go to understand the effect of such interactions. The added stresses, resulting from a “more crowded” Arctic, may play an important role in the future welfare of Polar Bears.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Other threats include overgrazing by livestock and landscape development (e.g., roads, houses, mining), which may reduce habitat quality for the species. The decline of marmots may also impact the species in some areas, as Corsacs often use marmot burrows as daytime resting locations. Further studies on the impacts of land use/development and interactions with other species are needed.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

The isolation of populations due to habitat fragmentation taking place for agricultural development (rice paddies, maize) also threatens the genetic viability of small populations in Viet Nam (Nadler et al. 2003). In Guangxi province, China, the threat of hunting is extremely severe, due to the illegal production of “black ape wine,” which is made specifically from this species; the animals are even imported illegally from Viet Nam for this purpose.

The deforested area where the species arrived in 2012 was 3,132km² (ProDes 2014). However, the percentage of habitat loss inside Protected Areas and Indigenous land was low (0.1%). Barber et al. (2012) argue that the most basic measure of the effectiveness of a protected area is how well its forest cover has been and continues to be preserved. Protected Areas and Indigenous Land are effective to assure a low index of deforestation, to face the different pressures identified for that region. Although currently not threatened, a number of plausible future threats and how they would influence this species are highlighted below:1. Environmental crime - Land grab and Selective logging by illegal wood companies are two criminal activities reported by local authorities. The land grabbers have illegal documents of land ownership. The illegal logging companies operate in the selective logging of tree species for commercial interest. After that, the land is occupied for clear cutting and implementation of pastures (Loureiro & Pinto 2005).2. Expansion of cattle ranching - According to IBGE (2014) Novo Aripuanã and Apuí, the two main cities where Mico chrysoleucus occurs, sum of 160,100 herds, are classified between the top five cities where cattle ranching is increasing continually.3. Improvement of the road system - The road AM 174 connects the Apuí and Novo Aripuanã cities throughout the M. chrysoleucus distribution. This road represents a pressure of new deforestation focus in a fishbone system, if no effective measure can be implemented to conciliate the Infrastructure improvement and Biodiversity Conservation.4. Hydroelectric Schemes - In 2012, the National Agency of Electrical Energy (ANEEL) approved the assessment of the hydroelectric potential of the Aripuanã and Roosevelt River basin, aiming the implementation of seven hydroelectric schemes (ANEEL 2012).  Two of these hydroelectric schemes will be implemented within the species’ geographical range, one in the “Prainha” area (Aripuanã River - 7º13’41’’S, 60º39’08’’W) and the other in the “Samaúma” area (7º54’44’’S, 60º11’48’’W). The reservoirs of “Prainha” and “Samaúma” will directly affect the area of occurrence of M. chrysoleucus as well as Mico marcai and Callibella humilis, the marmosets found in the left bank of Aripuanã River. The two planned hydroelectric schemes are expected to flood an area of 682,30km² (ANEEL 2012).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Myxomatosis is a South  American virus, primarily spread by insect (mosquito and flea) vectors,  that was intentionally introduced by a farmer in the mid-1950s in France  to control the rabbit population (Lavazza and Cooke 2018). An estimated  90% of European Rabbits perished due to myxomatosis after the first  outbreaks in the 1950s (Muñoz 1960), after that, the disease became  endemic to Iberia, where it currently affects most rabbit populations  (Villafuerte et al. 2017). After symptom onset, death  results in an average of 13 days. Rabbits with the virus are made more  vulnerable to predators (Villafuerte et al. 1995) and more susceptible to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD; Barnett et al. 2018). Juveniles are more susceptible to myxomatosis than adults (Villafuerte et al. 2017). Myxomatosis cases peak during early summer to fall (Villafuerte et al. 2017).Rabbit  Haemorrhagic Disease is caused by a lagovirus that appeared in Europe  in the late 1980’s, initially causing the death of 55-75% of rabbits in  the Iberian Peninsula (Villafuerte et al. 1995). RHD is  primarily spread by direct contact. Death typically results within 24  hours of symptom onset, with a short incubation time of under 48 hours  (Villafuerte et al. 1995). Adult rabbits are more  susceptible to RHD than juveniles (unlike myxomatosis), and RHD is more  prevalent in late winter and spring. Global warming may increase disease  incidence by creating a warmer, drier climate in Spain and Portugal  (Ward 2005).The new variant of RHD (GI.2/RHD2/b) was originally  described in France in 2010, and since 2011-2012 it has caused  wide-spread mortality among European Rabbits in Spain (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2014b) and Portugal (Monterroso et al.  2016). Declines of from 75% - 80% within two years have decimated many  populations of European Rabbits – particularly in their native habitat,  which coincides with core habitat occupied by Iberian Lynx  (Delibes-Mateos et al. 20014b, Monterroso et al. 2016). The new variant has fully replaced classic RHD strains in Spain and Portugal (Calvete et al. 2014, Lopes et al. 2015). Unlike classic RHD, the new variant kills young rabbits (Dalton et al. 2012, Abrantes et al. 2013), compromising population recruitment.Habitat loss and fragmentation are continuing to cause declines in European Rabbits (Delibes-Mateos et al.  2010), which require pastures-crops and scrub- forest vegetation for  food and shelter, respectively (Moreno and Villafuerte 1995). Modern  intensive agriculture negatively impacts rabbits more than small scale  mixed farming, which may have initially increased suitable habitat  within the rabbit’s natural range (Delibes-Mateos et al.  2010). High intensity livestock production and high ungulate numbers  contributes to habitat degradation and resource competition (Carpio et al.  2014). Fallow farm land often returns to closed forest rather than open  scrub, which is not a suitable habitat (Moreno and Villafuerte 1995,  Calvete et al. 2004). Tree plantations planted in Spain  and Portugal have replaced habitat for both rabbits and their predators  and urbanization presents a threat as does increased fire danger in  existing habitat, and climate change (Ward 2005, Tablado and Revilla  2012).Exploitation of European Rabbis by humans may have become a  threat in some places, especially in the case of populations that are  already declining due to other causes, so rabbits cannot sustain hunting  and control measures as well as in the past. As an example, in Aragón  (northeastern Spain) the strongest negative rabbit population trends  were found in areas with high hunting pressure (Williams et al. 2007). Farmers and hunters control rabbit populations in farmland areas directly by shooting and trapping (Ríos-Saldaña et al.  2010). Farming indirectly causes decline through habitat conversion and  excessive pesticide and fertilizer use. Over 70% of Spain is designated  as hunting area, and in recent years some hunters have reported a 70% -  80% decline in hunting success due to lower rabbit populations  resulting from the new variant of RHDv (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2014b).Future  threats to the European Rabbit may include genetically modified  versions of the rabbit viruses being developed in Australia to reduce  rabbit numbers where the species is a major pest. Unlicensed release of  modified viruses to the native range could devastate the remaining  populations (Angulo 2001). Finally. the mixture of both subspecies due  the restocking of rabbits for hunting or predator conservation purposes,  may also become a threat by losing the natural genetic diversity  compromising the survival and reproduction in the wild (Piorno et al. 2015).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In addition, the encroachment of local communities with dogs and livestock has led to the disappearance of Kaokoveld Slender Mongoose from several areas in northern Namibia.

Although it is unlikely that the species will wander into gardens and orchards of villages and get into direct conflict with people, suggesting that there will be only little targeted hunting as a pest, it is still exposed to these indiscriminate hunting methods, which occur deep within some forest-blocks in its range, due to its ground-dwelling nature.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

This is widespread and intense, particularly in Lao PDR and Viet Nam but, even there, this species persists widely, including in areas with heavy human use. As a ground-dwelling animal, potentially suffering from widespread market-driven trapping in this region (where many other species have declined steeply), this suggests a strong resilience. However, it is evidently absent from, or at least very rare in, the plains of Lao PDR. These are more accessible than are the hills and, in general, hunting of mammals has been even more damaging in them. The rarity or absence there of Crab-eating Mongoose might reflect hunting-led extirpation (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014); this is probably more likely than a natural absence from such areas, given the species' occurrence in lowland plains parts of Cambodia and Thailand (Chutipong et al. 2014, D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014). There is no demand for its meat in restaurants in Viet Nam (S. Roberton pers. comm. 2008) and no evidence of directed hunting of the species. Retaliatory killing for raiding poultry on farms occurs, but is not a population-level threat. There are no records from wholly agricultural or otherwise anthropogenic landscapes, indicating a degree of dependence on forest. Many recent records are, however, from highly fragmented and/or degraded forest. In Nepal and, formerly, in Viet Nam there are records from agricultural land (Pham-Chong-Anh 1980, Thapa 2013); nowadays, in its core range of northern Southeast Asia, such areas are mostly heavily hunted and are unlikely to support resident populations. It is possible that the species is widely excluded from farmland by hunting. In sum, with the exclusion of outright deforestation, the threats to this species from habitat change (degradation and fragmentation) are mainly indirect, through the increased hunting and trading that occurs in accompaniment over most of Southeast Asia.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

In southern China this species has historically been one of the most important furbearers and is subjected to heavy harvest pressure (Shou 1962, Sheng 1993, Storz and Wozencraft 1999) and declines have occurred because of this (Lau et al. 2010). However, even in southern China the genus, apparently mostly this species, remains common and widespread (Lau et al. 2010). In the northern part of its range, in central China, because this species is perceived neither to prey on livestock, nor cause to damage to property or farm facilities, it is not persecuted, despite its close proximity to people (Wang and Fuller 2003). In addition, the value of an individual pelt is not high, although the meat is eaten in some areas (Wang and Fuller 2003). Also in the Chinese part of its range there seems to be little threat from habitat change, given the species's occurrence in highly anthropogenic environments. Understanding threats further south in its range, where it is or might be sympatric with Large-toothed Ferret Badger, is forestalled by the difficulties of identification to species. Ferret badgers of one or more species are among the most widely camera-trapped small carnivores in Viet Nam, including in very heavily hunted areas where most species are now rare (Willcox et al. 2014); perhaps the species is as resilient in South-east Asia as it is further north.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Ferret badgers are often caught in snares and indeed various recent records identified to species come from salvage from snare lines (e.g., Abramov and Rozhnov 2014). It is quite plausible that such hunting keeps populations artificially low in these areas.

First, while Eastern Spotted Skunk is currently reported as infrequent, incidental captures by fur trappers and the historical overharvest could have contributed to population declines (Gompper and Hackett 2005). Second, the timing of declines in the mid 20th century coincides with the first wide-scale use of synthetic pesticides, suggesting a possible link between synthetic pesticide use and spotted skunk declines. Third, landscape change associated with modern row-crop agriculture, mesophitication of eastern forests, or other large-scale habitat alterations have negatively affected the availability of early successional forest habitat and shrub cover prefered by the species. Interestingly, this has been most recently been observed in attempts to conserve Red-cockaded Woodpecker Leuconotopicus borealis, where pine stands managed with an open understorey for conservation of the endangered woodpecker conflict with management strategies for this skunk, which requires dense understory (Lesmeister et al. 2013). Fourth, predator communities have similarly changed over the past century, potentially leading to altered competition dynamics. Fifth, a number of diseases could be linked to spotted skunk decline, including parvoviruses, distemper virus, and rabies (Gompper in revision). Overall, it is likely that simultaneously several of these threats influenced, and continue to influence, Eastern Spotted Skunk populations, and that threats could differ somewhat between subspecies.

Declines may also be related to the persecution of its primary prey, prairie-dogs and ground squirrels (Apps et al. 2002). Finley et al. (1976) speculated that some Colorado populations may have declined because of the elimination of prairie-dogs. Roadkills and habitat loss are the main threats in British Columbia (Newhouse and Kinley 2012). Trapping for pelts has in the past affected populations, mainly in response to high fur prices, but has not had a significant influence on populations in recent years. Badgers are also trapped, shot and poisoned because their diggings are thought to cause broken legs in livestock, lead to water loss from irrigation canals, and cause damage to vehicles encountering their burrows (Scobie 2002).Although clearing of forests for agricultural land has probably resulted in some range expansion, cultivation of grassland has undoubtedly caused declines (Soper 1964, Stardom 1979, Lindzey 1982, Smith 1992). Likewise, intensification of agriculture is likely to cause declines in the future.Much mortality is caused by vehicles or deliberate killing by people (Stardom 1979, Messick et al. 1981, Newhouse and Kinley 2012, Apps et al. 2002). Badgers may actually be attracted to roads, both because ground squirrels often burrow alongside them (Ketcheson and Bauer 1995), and because they are good travel routes (Warner and Ver Steeg 1995).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Among these are significant cultural and political changes (Bouman and Bouman 1994), hunting (Zhao and Liang 1992, Bouman and Bouman 1994), military activities (Ryder 1993), climatic change (Sokolov et al. 1992), and competition with livestock and increasing land use pressure (Sokolov et al. 1992, Ryder 1993, Bouman and Bouman 1994). Capture expeditions probably diminished the remaining Przewalski's Horse populations by killing and dispersing the adults (Van Dierendonck and de Vries 1996). The harsh winters of 1945, 1948, and 1956 probably had an additional impact on the small population (Bouman and Bouman 1994). Increased pressure on, and rarity of waterholes in their last refuge should also be considered as a significant factor contributing to their extinction (Van Dierendonck and de Vries 1996).For the reintroduced populations, small population size and limited spatial distribution is the primary threat, followed by potential hybridization with domestic horses and competition for resources with domestic horses and other livestock. Wherever Przewalski's Horses come into contact with domestic horses, there is the risk of hybridization and transmission of diseases. Recently, illegal mining in the protected areas is an additional threat to their viability. In Hustai NP it has been noted that overgrazing of the buffer-zone and continued pressure on the reserve are possible consequences of the enhanced economic activity in this area (Bouman 1998); however, the second phase of the project (1998-2003) paid much more attention to sustainable development of the buffer-zone. In the western section of the Great Gobi B SPA livestock grazing by nomads and military personnel continues, particularly in fall, winter and spring; however, the core zone is largely free from human influence all year round. Infectious diseases transmitted from domestic horses and their parasites, notably Babesia equi, B. caballi and strangles (infection by Streptococcus equi), are a major threat to small reintroduced populations originating from zoos (Roberts et al. 2005, King and Gurnell 2005). As was observed during 2009/2010, severe winters can result in significant mortality. While predation occurs naturally as for any wild ungulate, if excessive there could be impacts on this small population.There is concern over loss of genetic diversity after being reduced to a very small population and maintained in captivity for several generations. Sixty per cent of the unique genes of the studbook population have been lost (Ryder 1994). Loss of founder genes is irretrievable and further losses must be minimized through close genetic management. Furthermore, inbreeding depression could become a population-wide concern as the population inevitably becomes increasingly inbred (Ballou 1994). However, correct management of the population can slow these losses significantly, as has been achieved since the organization of the regional captive-breeding programs. Fortunately, Przewalski's Horses have been shown to have both higher nuclear and mitochondrial nucleotide diversity than many domestic horse breeds in spite of the population bottlenecks they have experienced (Goto et al. 2011).At the ‘Endangered Wild Equid Workshop’ held in Ulaanbataar in 2010 the following threats were identified:Loss of population due to stochastic events (i.e. severe winter);Limited habitat and resources (pasture and water);Domestic horses (hybridization, disease, social stress);Lack of information, appreciation / awareness, lack of knowledge; andExploitation of resources (i.e. mining).Specific actions needed for each threat category were identified and described.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

It is likely that it cannot survive total deforestation, but at least in some parts of its range, it clearly persists in degraded and fragmented forest (albeit at lower apparent abundance, at least in northern Borneo; J. Brodie pers. comm. 2014) and makes ready use of adjacent non-forest habitats such as agriculture. It occurs over a wide altitudinal range including into the upper montane levels. With a large proportion of its population in tropical hill forest, which in South-east Asia is being converted to non-forest use more slowly than is lowland forest, while the species has lost a large proportion of its range a few centuries ago, current rates of loss are relatively low and do not threaten the species except locally. It is a major component of the 'wild' mammal restaurant trade in southern China, but most of the individuals seem to come from farms (e.g., Li and Li 1998, Lau et al. 2010), and is eaten widely elsewhere in its range, notably Viet Nam (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014). General mammal hunting is very heavy across parts of its range (such as northern South-east Asia), but because Masked Palm Civet is quite arboreal, and so spends that proportion of its time outside the range of snares and most other traps, it is less exposed to hunting than are the more ground-dwelling small carnivores. Being largely nocturnal, it probably escapes the attentions of dogs and of much opportunistic hunting Thus, it is still detected widely even in heavily snared parts of Viet Nam (Willcox et al. 2014: Table SOM3), which support among the highest levels of such hunting of anywhere in the species's range, and it remains secure in heavily hunted parts of south China where most other carnivores are now very rare (Lau et al. 2010). Overall, therefore, the level of threat from these factors is assessed as relatively low, despite the likelihood that in some areas (e.g., Viet Nam) they are likely to be causing widespread declines.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Choudhury pers. comm. 2014). Dead individuals of this species were found with local tribes during a visit to Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu and Agra, Uttar Pradesh in India between 1998 and 2003, where it is killed for its meat (Gupta 2004). Hunting in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, India, has apparently much declined (Kalle et al. 2013), and this is probably typical for India excepting the North-east. It is commonly sold in Javan, and to a lesser extent Philippine, markets for the pet trade (Nijman et al. 2014, P. Widmann pers. comm. 2014). It is also persecuted as a pest (e.g., Gupta 2004, Su Su 2005) although it seems able to tolerate very high levels of persecution (e.g. Duckworth 1997). While these pressures are certainly having localised effects on populations in highly fragmented and ‘humanised’ areas, such as Houay Nhang (Lao PDR), there is no evidence in mainland South-east Asia of them significantly reducing the population levels in large tracts of natural and semi-natural habitat, even in the heavily hunted countries of Lao PDR and Viet Nam; while in much of India it is a common urban commensal (e.g. Gupta 2004). There has been a recent great increase in numbers kept captive for the production of civet coffee, especially in Indonesia (e.g. Shepherd 2012, Nijman et al. 2014) and to a lesser extent, in the Philippines (P. Widmann pers. comm. 2014). Large numbers of live Common Palm Civets are traded internationally and when trade confiscations occur, animals are typically released close to site of confiscation. Given that some trade goes from Sundaic South-east Asia to China (e.g. Bell et al. 2004), it is highly likely that many individuals of one clade/subspecies/species (see 'Taxonomic notes') are being released within the range of another; this has the risk of hybridisation/introgression, or of competitive exclusion (depending on whether the different forms are reproductively isolated; this remains unknown).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

They are frequently found trapped for meat in other countries, including Sierra Leone, Cameroon, Republic of Congo, DR Congo and Central African Republic (Ray 2013). The majority of animals (generally males, because of their higher civet musk production) kept for the trade of civetone are taken from the wild, and such off-takes are likely to have localised impacts on wild populations, as well as potentially to lead to a severely female-biased sex ratio. In addition, several African Civets have been reported to die within the first three weeks of capture because of severe stress and physical assault during capture and transportation (Pugh 1998).

USFWS acknowledged that sylvatic plague has been and continues to be the primary mortality factor for Gunnison's prairie dog, especially at specific sites, but concluded that the impact that this disease has had on the overall status of the species is unclear. This species reproduces slowly relative to other rodents, and survivorship is low (Hoogland 2001).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Abundant rocks also provide a very uniform subterranean environment that is not particularly vulnerable to disturbance. However, Fichtel (pers. comm., 1992), in discussing threats to the habitat of the long-tailed shrew (Sorex dispar) in Vermont, suggested that ski area development may destroy habitats of this sort. Logging does not appear to have any immediate adverse impact (Kirkland 1977). In fact, at three West Virginia sites, rock voles were more than twice as abundant on recent clearcuts as on adjacent uncut stands (Kirkland 1977). The rock vole is a habitat specialist and occurs in isolated colonies throughout its range (Banfield 1974, Kirkland and Jannett 1982, Majumdar et al. 1986, Kirkland and Krim 1990). Chemical and heavy metal pollution may have less effect on this primarily vegetarian species than on predators in the same habitat. Brooks and Healy (1988), working in West Virginia and Massachusetts hardwood forests, concluded that both intermediate thinning and clearcutting have minimal or ephemeral effects on small mammal communities, but that ""long-term, high deer populations may permanently alter habitat structure to the extent that changes occur in small mammal community composition.""

Especially within Lao PDR and Viet Nam, there is indiscriminate snaring throughout its known range, for local meat consumption and a thriving bushmeat trade (see Timmins et al. 2007). However, the best protection from hunting at present is the ‘cushioning’ effect of large forest blocks, where the costs of extracting wildlife of low to medium commercial value from the centre are higher than the income from selling it, and where habitat is so extensive it is simply more difficult to hunt out cryptic, non-gregarious species, than it is in smaller forest blocks. Because most such blocks within the complex’s geographical range are centred on rugged terrain, with higher elevations forming the core of such areas, these muntjacs are likely to be significantly less threatened than are sympatric ground-dwelling mammals with altitudinal ranges limited to lower elevations. However, in the very heavily impacted Vietnamese regions of the Northern and Central Annamites the species-complex has almost certainly undergone a decline equivalent to Endangered listing.In localized areas, especially of northern Indochina, the species-complex is likely to be affected by habitat loss. Here, most ethnic groups practice shifting cultivation and in recent decades there has been a clear net loss and fragmentation of forest: such shifting cultivation is not now in a balanced cycle (for rotational systems), or never was (frontier systems). The adaptability of the species-complex to degraded or fragmented habitats is not well known, although evidence from northern Lao PDR suggests that animals there persist in landscape-scale mosaics including extensive secondary, degraded forest fragments and cultivation (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2006). In general it appears that muntjacs (particularly M. vaginalis and M. reevesi) adapt well to secondary and degraded habitats and in fact may reach higher densities in such areas than they do in unencroached habitats. More serious than losses to shifting cultivation, in the most recent years and the immediate future, is likely to be the large-scale replacement of natural forests (albeit mostly heavily degraded) with rubber plantations to supply the burgeoning Chinese market, and other agro-industry plantations. This is affecting large areas of the northern highlands of Lao PDR and elsewhere, and will have three linked negative effects on ground-dwelling mammals: direct loss of habitat (it is unlikely that rubber plantations will support even mediocre densities of this species-complex, although this is not yet known), decline and destabilization of the forest resource-base (including wild-meat sources) for subsistence-level communities, leading to higher hunting levels in remaining wildlife areas (C. Wood pers. comm. 2005 to J.W.

The hunting is mainly for local subsistence use.Due to the reduction in water points (oases) because of drought, wolves have increased their predation of Wild Bactrian Camels. This activity is concentrated at the remaining water points in the area. The remaining habitat in Mongolia is also being degraded by domestic livestock.In China in the new Arjin Shan Lop Nur Nature Sanctuary, up to 20 Wild Bactrian Camels are killed annually by miners and hunters for subsistence use. Economic pressure to use the areas adjoining the Nature Reserve as grazing for domestic Bactrian camels has increased  hybridisation on the southern border and this poses a significant threat to the unique genetic strain of the Wild Bactrian Camel which current scientific DNA research suggests is a separate species.For 45 years, this area of the Gashun Gobi was the nuclear test site area of China. In spite of this, the Wild Bactrian Camel survived and is apparently breeding naturally. Since the cessation of nuclear tests in China, the Wild Bactrian Camel now faces new threats including highly toxic illegal mining and hunting for food and sport. Parts of the Wild Bactrian Camel's designated habitat are likely to be designated for industrial use (gas pipe line laying, exploitation of minerals).  Domestic Bactrian camels and goats have also been introduced to the designated areas and hence compete for grazing and water.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

National Parks such as Katios and Orquideas are believed to have very few spider monkeys because of indigenous hunting pressure (N. Vargas pers. comm.; H.

Widespread censuses of Ateles are needed, especially in national parks.In Colombia, along the Atlantic coast, it has been estimated that over 30% of habitat has been lost in the past 10 years based on calculations from satellite photos (Miller et al, 2004). Ground truthing of this data found only 2.5% of viable secondary forest habitat was left in this region (Miller et al. 2004).

While it is clear that the genus remains widespread and common in its Sundaic range in the face of these threats, few data to support assessment specifically of Lesser Chevrotain’s current status were traced: many key studies there have not identified chevrotains to species. In the non-Sundaic areas, evaluation of resilience is hampered by evident heterogeneity of chevrotain occurrence with a lack of convergence of opinion as to explanations of some.North of the sympatry with T. napu, T kanchil is heavily hunted and is often considered one of the most preferred wild meats (Srikosmatara et al. 1992, Duckworth et al. 1999, Kuznetzov and Borissenko 2004, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2006, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Nonetheless, it is clear that T. kanchil is adept at surviving in areas (at least in the lowland plains) in the face of very heavy hunting, major habitat degradation and isolation from other forest areas. Exemplifying this, it was one of the few mammals larger than a rat confirmed to persist at Houay Nhang, an isolate of a few km² of highly degraded forest just outside the capital of Vientiane facing, in the early 1990s, exceedingly concentrated hunting with guns and snares (Duckworth et al. 1994). A little to the west it persists in Sangthong district, which was heavily logged just before a 1996 survey and also supported heavy hunting (Duckworth 1996). These two areas are within 10 and 70 km, respectively, of, and ecologically contiguous with, Thangon, from where Osgood (1932) reported specimens of T. kanchil (confirmed by E. Meijaard pers. comm. 2008 as this species), and thus the modern records probably do relate to T. kanchil. Hansel (2004) provided a further record from the adjacent low hills. Numbers of chevrotains in Vientiane markets in the early 1990s (Srikosamatara et al. 1992) were so high that they could not be at the brink of extinction in this degraded and fragmented landscape. Chevrotains are still common in trade in the city, although mostly in transit rather than on open sale in the city’s markets, and their origin is not clear (T. Hansel pers. comm. 2008). The genus was recently camera-trapped quite commonly in a part of Nakai–Nam Theun NPA where ground mammals were much depleted (Johnson and Johnston 2007), perhaps indicating higher resilience than many other mammals, although there is no information to compare with pre-exploitation levels. While non-Sundaic chevrotains can, therefore, clearly persist under extreme pressures in at least some circumstances, this does not rule out that densities might be quickly reduced through the twin pressures of hunting and habitat degradation. Decreasing population densities between the 1970s and 1990s, in at least parts of southern Viet Nam, were suggested by both spot-lighting surveys and qualitative assessments of footprints. Near Buon Luoi in December 1978, chevrotains were spotlit at about three animals per 5 km of transect route, but by 1993, when forest had undergone heavy degradation and hunting was very heavy, chevrotains were not even found every night with at least 10 km of transect (Kuznetzov and Borissenko 2004). Kuznetzov and Borissenko (2004) proposed that night-time hunting may explain chevrotain’s near-absence from habitats with open-understory (this feature allowing chevrotains to be readily hunted using spotlights and guns) in the Buon Luoi area, because by contrast in Cat Tien National Park, where the use of firearms has been banned for decades and enforcement is fairly effective, chevrotains are encountered with comparable frequency both in thickets and on exposed forest floor (Borissenko and Ivanova 2003). This sighting rates contrast is consistent with a difference between the headquarters area of Khao Yai National Park, Thailand (where chevrotains are readily found by spotlight) and which is relatively well-protected from hunting, and Lao forests (see above) where hunting was effectively unrestrained (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). However, a proposal that, where hunting is unrestrained, as it is in most of Viet Nam and Lao PDR, chevrotains would be common in heavy forest but have been effectively eradicated from such habitat, is flawed for at least Lao PDR, where numbers of forest mammals killed through spotlight hunting are probably insignificant compared with those trapped (including with snares) and perhaps even killed using dogs (J.W. Duckworth and R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, based on numbers of active hunters encountered at nigh versus traps found, in many areas of Lao PDR). Kuznetzov and Borissenko (2004) based their reasoning on only two sites and it is possible that other factors explain the differences. In sum, the effects of hunting and habitat modification, and the interaction between them, on non-Sundaic chevrotains remain most unclear.The effects of potential threats operating in the Sundaic range are not understood well, either. Lesser Oriental Chevrotain is now rather rare on Singapore (K. Lim pers. comm. 2008), presumably nowadays constrained by habitat quality rather than by ongoing hunting, although the role of free-ranging dogs, if any, in restraining population numbers is unclear. However, the ‘island within an island’ situation of remaining forest on Singapore and the extreme habitat loss over the last 150 years prevent useful extrapolation of this species' situation there to other Sundaic areas. Poaching pressure in Kerinci-Seblat National Park, Sumatra, among snared ungulates was greatest for muntjacs and lowest for chevrotains, as assessed by diameter of the cable (Linkie et al. 2003). Chevrotains were more than nine times as abundant in areas of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Sumatra, with low than with high human population density within 10 km of the park boundary, suggesting low resilience to human presence, presumably the effects of hunting (O'Brien et al. 2003); note that it is not confirmed that this information refers to T. kanchil. Bennett et al. (2000) profiled the effects of hunting in both Bornean states of Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah), each with eight study areas, upon chevrotains (not distinguished to species) through a lengthy hunting study in February 1993 to June 1995. They constituted 8–9% of animals killed. No direct or index measure of chevrotain densities was possible at these sites to determine what effects, if any, such heavy hunting was having on chevrotains. Chevrotains are among the most favoured wild meat by inhabitants of the Sarawak Planted Forests area, Bintulu, Sarawak, after Sambar Rusa unicolor and wild pigs Sus (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008). Logging can apparently drive substantial reductions in density, at least locally, although other studies have found it allows an increase in numbers (see Habitat and ecology). No information on the use of plantation landscapes has been traced. In the Greater Sundas, lowland forest is being converted at unprecedented high rates. At least in Borneo, where this species is concentrated in areas below 100 m asl, most of its habitat either has been substantially modified during the last two decades or will be in the next two (e.g. Holmes 2000, BirdLife International 2001, Jepson et al. 2001, McMorrow and Talip 2001, Lambert and Collar 2002, Fuller et al. 2003, Kinnaird et al. 2003, Curran et al. 2004, Fuller 2004, Eames et al. 2005, Aratrakorn et al. 2006). However, inferring proportionately large population losses in Lesser Chevrotain populations is not possible: depending on how serious hunting is and what exactly is being done to the habitat post-logging (forest regeneration, tree plantation or non-woody habitat) in any given area, chevrotain numbers might remain broadly unaffected, decrease or increase in logged-over areas.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Hunting may also be causing localised declines, for example through extirpations from small isolated karsts (as suggested by villagers to Nicolas et al. 2012), but is unlikely to have any major effect on the overall population. An attempt in about 2009 to enter the interior of Phou Hinpoun NBCA, to survey the Lao Leaf Monkey Trachypithecus laotum, failed to find any villagers who had penetrated the area or were willing to try. The survey team pressed on alone and after several days wandering looking for water had to abort the attempt (J. W. Duckworth pes. comm. 2016). Even on isolated karsts, war scrap, one of the most lucrative non-timber forest products and thus one for which its presence is a good indicator of low human entry, could readily, as of 2008, be found within an hour’s walk of the karst edge in central Lao PDR (Woxvold et al. 2009). On the assumption that the Kha-nyou occurs across the karst blocks which it inhabits, rather than just at their margins, the majority of the population is in areas not hunted through their remoteness from human settlements. Tree cover in peripheral and accessible karst areas is very vulnerable to loss due to logging and firewood removal. However, forest cover remained, as of 2008, extensive within Phou Hinpoun NBCA (Alström et al. 2009), most of this being outside the areas regularly entered by villagers. This species has, through its obligate karst association, a distribution including a number of small isolates as well as larg contiguousblocks; only very limited gene flow was detected between all populations (Nicolas et al. 2012). Although this is not a threat to the species as here defined, any taxonomically distinct populations confined to small (under 50 km²) karsts are at high risk, at least potentially.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

The northern highlands of Thailand, China and Indochina are generally subject to heavy hunting from local people, often with high densities of snares suitable to catch animals like chevrotains. At least in Indochina, chevrotains are a favoured quarry (Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002, Johnson et al. 2003, Anak Pattanavibool pers. comm. 2006, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). There is an enormous trade in wild meat from rural areas to markets in adjacent towns, those further afield, across international borders and up into, particularly, Viet Nam and China (e.g. Compton and Le Hai Quang 1998, Compton et al. 1999, Noreen and Claridge 2001). However, whether the species would be significantly threatened by such activity is unknown (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008); it might be one of several ungulates that is remarkably resilient. Despite extensive forest disturbance through shifting cultivation in the species' likely range, habitat-related factors may only have been a relatively minor threat to date, if indeed one at all, given the adaptability of the genus to disturbed and secondary habitats (see other species 2008 Red List accounts). This may be changing fast, because the northern highlands of Lao PDR and adjacent areas are currently seeing heavy conversion of forest (albeit mostly secondary and regrowth, which is all that survives in large areas) to plantations to supply the burgeoning Chinese market for rubber. This will have three linked negative effects on ground-dwelling mammals: direct loss of forest habitat, decline and destabilization of the forest resource-base (including wild-meat sources) for subsistence-level communities, leading to higher hunting levels in remaining wildlife areas (C. Wood pers. comm. 2005 to J.W. Duckworth, based on emerging patterns across several provinces in Lao PDR’s northern highlands); and shrinkage of the size of natural habitat blocks and thereby reduction and, locally, loss, of the cushioning effect which allows hunted wildlife to persist in large blocks of forest when eradicated from smaller blocks. Although this habitat trend is not in doubt, it is entirely unknown to what extent rubber plantations will support chevrotains in northern Southeast Asia, so effects on the genus cannot be predicted.

This threat is particularly strong across the “deforestation arch” in the southern Brazilian Amazon, a region that extends from the state of Acre eastward to the southern states of Pará and Maranhão.Although the Amazon forest has been destroyed for many reasons, the main cause of deforestation is cattle raising, responsible for 70% of forest loss in the Brazilian Amazon (Fearnside 2005). Besides the destruction of forest, the cattle itself may negatively affect deer populations through a variety of parasitic, bacterial or viral diseases that can contaminate them. Indeed, Pinder and Leeuwenberg (1997) mentioned that there are reports of high mortality rates of deer previously in contact with ill cattle in the Brazilian Pantanal region and the states of Maranhão and Minas Gerais. The extent to which the cattle affect populations of M. nemorivaga is unknown.Fortunately, overhunting appears not to be a threat to Mazama nemorivaga. This species is usually less abundant than the sympatric red brocket deer (M. americana), but also has lower hunting pressure. Branan et al. (1985) reported the harvest of 5 individuals of the former species against 57 individuals of the latter by Surinamese hunters in 1980 and 1981. Similarly, Hurtado-Gonzales and Bodmer (2004) found a rate of 0.06 individuals hunted/km² for M. nemorivaga in contrast to 0.17 individuals hunted/km² for M. americana in a heavy hunted site in northeastern Peru. In addition to the low hunting pressure, most studies on the sustainability of hunting by Peruvian rural and indigenous people reported that the harvest of Mazama nemorivaga is within sustainable limits (Ascorra 1997, Bodmer 1995, Bodmer et al. 1997, Hurtado-Gonzales and Bodmer 2004, Mena et al. 2000). There are two likely reasons for that. First, brockets (including M. americana and M. nemorivaga) can be categorized as less vulnerable to overhunting because of their fast rates of reproduction and intrinsic rates of population increase, allied to the ability of dispersal and difficulty of capture (see Bodmer et al. 1997, and Hurtado-Gonzales and Bodmer 2004). Second, slightly or unhunted areas adjacent to persistently hunted ones may have been acting as sources of game, as claimed by Novaro et al. (2000). According to them, 47 to 87% of unhunted area close to the catchment site is required to prevent a population decline of Amazonian Brown Brocket in the Peruvian Amazon.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Many relatively high-volume illicit wildlife trade links pass through M. cupreus’s range, so it is certain to be under some level of threat from trade. The unstable taxonomy hampers abilities to assess threat levels directly to species, especially as parts like pods are not readily identifiable to species anyway.Besides hunting for meat, which is considered a delicacy locally, hunting of the Muskdeer is primarily for trade of musk glands, which reached the area reportedly only 30 years ago and has led to a substantial increase in hunting since then. The musk produced by this genus of primitive deer is highly valued for its cosmetic and alleged pharmaceutical properties, and can fetch U.S. $45,000 per kilogram (2.2 pounds) on the international market. Although this musk, produced in a gland of the males, can be extracted from live animals, most ""musk-gatherers"" kill the animals to remove the entire sac, which yields only about 25 grams (1/40 of a kilogram) of the brown waxy substance. Such poaching is relatively easy to accomplish and difficult to stop using only legal means. Today local hunters are reportedly able to get ca $200-250 per musk gland from mostly foreign traders (the main market is reportedly in the Middle East). The increased availability of guns over the last few decades and the political instability in the area, which has resulted in a basically uncontrolled trade to bordering Pakistan, have added significantly to the amount of wildlife being hunted for trade. During the summer the species stays in higher mountain regions and is apparently opportunistically hunted by shepherds (almost all of whom carry guns for hunting purposes). Most animals are reportedly hunted in winter when Muskdeer distribution and ranging patterns are most predictable. As reported, the species is exclusively hunted with guns; snares apparently are not being used at least in the area surveyed (WCS/USAID Afghanistan Biodiversity Conservation Program / M. Karlstetter pers. comm. 2008).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

There is now, overall, rather little forest habitat left in the wet zone: only 1,440 km2 of rainforest were estimated to remain in Sri Lanka by Collins et al. (1991), and only 9% forest cover was estimated to remain in the wet zone (IUCN/WCMC 1997). This situation was caused by logging, fuelwood-gathering (domestic use and for brick-making), agricultural conversion (including for tree crops), mining, urbanisation, and fire (Collins et al. 1991). Legal protection of the remaining wet zone forests is quite effective (IUCN/WCMC 1997) but encroachment of human populations is fragmenting and degrading them (National Environment Action Plan 1998–2001). Even some protected areas have suffered severe degradation (Hoffmann 1996). In the decade up to 2008, there has been a major growth in tea small holdings within the wet zone, which were mostly forest patches until then (P. Fernando pers. comm. 2008). However, the level of threat these activities pose to Chevrotains is unclear, because in the wet zone Chevrotains are common wherever there is relatively undisturbed secondary or better forest (R. Pethiyagoda pers. comm. 2008). In fact, in the wet zone Chevrotains are more abundant in secondary forest than in primary, so habitat ""degradation"" by itself is unlikely to be a threat, especially as they also occur commonly in rubber plantations and home gardens (R. Pethiyagoda pers. comm. 2008). Sri Lankan Chevrotains are hunted, with firearms, for their meat in areas where security broke down during the civil war (Santiapillai and Wijeyamotan 2003), but it there is no reason to suppose that this is at levels sufficient to drive major population declines. Gun-hunting of birds was considered a limited threat, given the strict gun controls wrought by the security situation and the high cost of ammunition by BirdLife International (2001), but for Chevrotains snaring and other forms of trapping, not of concern to public order, may be more serious.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0

The volcano, Mt.  Karengentang, is active and dominates more than 50% of its geographical range. This threat is exacerbated by a relatively large human population (311 people/km²) that has converted virtually all of the primary habitat to some form of human use (Shekelle and Salim 2009a, 2009b). In these ways, Tarsius tumpara faces a set of threats similar to those faced by T. sangirensis, but the threats are more acute for T. tumpara: a smaller island, a more active volcano, and higher human population density. Most troubling, however, are numerous credible reports that the local human population regularly eats tarsiers, up to 5-10 animals at a sitting, and that tarsiers have been extirpated from areas where they were common as recently as 10 years ago.  Tarsius tumpara is considered to be one the world’s 25 most endangered primates by the IUCN Species Survival Commission Primate Specialist Group (Shekelle and Salim 2007, 2009b).

Deforestation in the lowlands areas of the Sierra de Aroa will reduce the availability of areas with optimal habitat for the species, as this process promotes the decrease of original habitat due vertical scrolling up of cloud forests, which is a serious problem considering that the Sierra de Aroa is an isolated massif.  Based on its elevational distribution, the estimated areas with suitable habitat available for presence of this species is approximately 24-40 km² (Quiroga-Carmona and Molinari 2012).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

A population decline in the past few years has been detected in Santa Catarina state in Brazil, the area considered the most important for its conservation, where the density estimates dropped by more than 50%, probably as a consequence of prey reduction (Oliveira et al. 2008, 2013; M.A. Tortato pers. comm.). Additionally, the existing global population is still suffering from habitat loss and fragmentation, which in the case of the Cerrado biome is undergoing high rates of loss (Klink and Machado 2005, MMA/IBAMA 2011). Other threats include hunting due to conflicts with rural owners, competition and diseases spread by domestic dogs, indiscriminate use of rodent poisoning, and road kills (Oliveira et al. 2008, 2013; Baréa and Leite 2012; R. Leite-Pitman and T. Trigo pers. comms.). It is also very important to consider the existence of an extensive hybridization zone between L. guttulus and Leopardus geoffroyi on the geographic limits of their distribution that may be affecting the genetic uniqueness of this species, as 38.2% of the Southern Tiger Cat specimens there are introgressed from the latter (Trigo et al. 2008, Trigo et al. 2013a).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Although international trade ceased, there is still some localized illegal hunting, usually for the domestic market. Current threats to this species include habitat loss, fragmentation, disease, road-kill, illegal trade (pets and pelts), retaliatory killing due to depredation of poultry (Oliveira et al. 2008, 2013; Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011; Diaz-Pulido et al. 2013; Marinho 2015). By and large, the greatest threat is the rampant rate of habitat loss, fragmentation and isolation. In the Andes cloud forests deforestation is mostly due to conversion to agriculture but also includes oil, hydroelectric dams, urban sprawl and road building (Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011, CI 2012). In the Brazilian Cerrado and Caatinga, suppression to agriculture is by far the main threat. In these domains the rate is actually higher in the area called MATOPIBA (the states of Maranhão, Tocantins, Piauí and Bahia), where it is twice as high as in the other parts of the country and which also comprises the main and most important area for the species (IBAMA/MMA 2011a, b; Oliveira 2011). Thus, populations in the core range area of Leopardus tigrinus range are getting ever increasingly reduced and fragmented. Change in native species dynamics (predator/competitor) could represent another previously undetected potential threat (Oliveira 2011, Oliveira et al. 2013). Hybridization with Pampas cat in all of northeast and central Brazil (the main range area for L. t. tigrinus) was detected in 100% of all specimens evaluated. This may be a natural or anthropogenic process and the extent of this as a threat is unknown (Trigo et al. 2013a), but would probably already compromise about 70-80% of the entire species population, or even more.

The introduction of animals from North America to Europe has also resulted in the spread of parasites and diseases to previously unaffected subpopulations (e.g. liver worms). In many areas hunting is strictly regulated on this species and harvests are used to control population growth as large predators have been removed or ""controlled"" over much of the range. Overhunting and habitat loss and fragmentation as a result of agricultural intensification and urbanisation are other pressures in some areas and for some subspecies, but they are not thought to pose a major threat to the species at present.In the former USSR, the species is heavily poached for food, and settlement, stock grazing (Petocz 1973). In Algeria and Tunisia, the species has declined due to overhunting, particularly during the Algerian War, and habitat degradation destruction and direct mortality from anthropogenic forest fires (DSG 1988). In Corsica and Sardinia, C. e. corsicanus declined as a result of hunting (Dolan 1988), similar to C. e. maral and C. e. brauneri in the Caucasus and Crimea.The Mesola Red Deer C. e. italicus is highly threatened and prone to inbreeding depression. Habitat improvement and reduction of competition with Fallow Deer has helped this subspecies, the establishment of additional populations is recommended with exchanges of animals between them to maintain genetic diversity and minimise the effects of inbreeding (Zachos et al. 2014). A National Conservation Plan for the conservation of Mesola Red Deer has been developed (Lovari and Nobili 2010).",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Forestry and agricultural practices in the southern range of the species have caused massive and extensive reductions in the extent of boreal forest in southern Canada. In these areas white-tailed deer have occupied modified boreal forests that are increasingly open agricultural fields and extensive deciduous forests. Diseases from deer may also be a threat to Alces alces.In Nova Scotia, Canada, where A. alces has been declared endangered, recovery issues have been listed as: genetic structure, health, illegal harvest, habitat suitability and fragmentation, and potential climate-related habitat change (Beazley et al. 2006).Human-caused habitat change is also the major force causing westward expansion into non-typical habitats (i.e., rainforest ecosystems) in British Columbia. The expansion occurred concomitant with extensive logging in the Coastal Mountain Range. This has led to concerns about the future of native deer (Odocoileus hemionus) with the introduction of this new alternate prey species for predators and the potential introduction of diseases (Darimont et al. 2005).A wasting disease has been reported, and its causes remain poorly understood (Frank 2004), but it is not considered to be a serious problem for the species. Overexploitation caused significant population declines and range contractions in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries, but since then populations have recovered (Ruusila and Kojola 2010, Bauer and Nygrén 1999). In most European range states, populations are controlled to prevent damage to forestry and arable crops (Bauer and Nygrén 1999).",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Deforestation and forest disturbance across its range have increased significantly since 2009. R. Rajaonson (pers. comm. 2014) estimates that deforestation in eastern forest increased from 0.5% per annum in 2005-2010 to 0.94% per annum in 2010-2013. Allnut et al. (2009) estimated that in Masoala National Park, annual rates of deforestation in the studied area increased to 1.27% per annum in 2011. High levels of illegal settlement in protected areas, especially around the Bay of Antongil, are linked to artisanal mining (for quartz) and logging of rosewood; hunting for food using dogs has increased greatly in these areas as a result. Some villages have seen increases in populations of between 200 and 300% (C. Golden pers. comm. 2014).This species is actively hunted for its meat by people. In north-east Madagascar, Farris et al. (in review a, pers. comm. 2014) found 28 Falanoucs reportedly consumed from 2005 to 2011 across four villages (143 households were surveyed) near the Makira Natural Park. Hunting rates were highest in non-degraded forest and were positively associated with Falanouc occupancy, meaning that hunters appear to be focusing their efforts in non-degraded forest where Falanouc is most abundant (Farris et al. in review a). Household interviews conducted by Madagasikara Voakajy (pers. comm. 2014) in the Moramanga region of eastern Madagascar in 2008-2009 suggested that 425 (28%) of 1,532 respondents interviewed in 129 villages had eaten Falanouc in the preceding year. Hunting is presumed to have increased significantly in many parts of the  species's range since 2009 because of less effective governance and  increased social instability following a coup d'etat. Competition with the introduced Small Indian Civet Viverricula indica is sometimes cited as a threat, although this might not be very significant. Competition with and predation by feral cats and dogs is more likely to be an important threat. Eastern Falanouc activity overlaps with that of Small Indian Civet, revealing the potential for increased interactions and competition (Farris et al. in review b). Eastern Falanouc presence and probability of occupancy is higher at sites where cats are most active. This may be a habitat-mediated relationship; but it presumably translates into increased interactions between these two species (Farris et al. in review c). Eastern Falanouc probability of occupancy increases dramatically when dogs are not present at a site and the two occur together less than expected across the landscape, meaning Falanouc does not use sites where dogs are highly active (Farris et al. in review c); perhaps dogs kill Falanoucs.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

This is because reasonably large populations of the species can be supported entirely within high elevation, steep, or excessively rough/rocky terrain that is used sparingly if at all by domestic livestock. Livestock does exist near P. nayaur subpopulations, and in specific situations there may be conflicts. However, in general, it appears that even relatively intensive livestock grazing does not prohibit healthy populations of P. nayaur. This is in marked contrast to livestock’s effect on some other wild species.Because access to Pseudois nayaur habitat is usually difficult and individual body-size is relatively small, market-based poaching for meat appears to be rare, at least in the northern portions of the Tibetan plateau. Locally-based, subsistence poaching has occurred frequently in recent years, and no doubt continues. However, China has recently begun implementing a new policy of confiscating all guns from nomadic pastoralists, and observations during 1998-2002 in Gansu and Qinghai provinces corroborate this (R. Harris pers. obs.). Thus, local herders now have little technology with which to poach P. nayaur for meat. International (“trophy”) hunting for P. nayaur occurs, but only in four to five designated areas in China and Nepal (and possibly in Pakistan), and in numbers too small to have substantial population impacts. It seems most likely, therefore, that human use of P. nayaur has been decreasing in recent years. International hunting (including for Blue Sheep) in China was suspended in 2006, and as of summer 2014 had not yet been re-established.An outbreak of sarcoptic mange was reported among P. nayaur in extreme northern Pakistan, and has markedly reduced abundance locally. This may yet be a cause for concern range-wide, but similar reports from elsewhere within the species’ range have not surfaced (Woodford 2003, 2006).In Bhutan, the species is not in immediate danger and numbers seem to be increasing due to the expansion of grazing areas for domestic yaks. However, heavy grazing by both species is damaging the fragile, high alpine vegetation, so Blue Sheep population trends may be reversed in the near future. In India the major threat is localized over-hunting, including that by the army in remote outposts. Within Nepal, although in some areas religious beliefs protect Blue Sheep from poaching, excessive competition from livestock grazing may cause habitat degradation in much of its natural range.

A major threat within this species’ range is mining (legal, illegal and recommissioning of old mines). Future developments at the above rates or even higher are likely to cause further detriment towards natural ecosystems and processes and in particular, disturb or destroy foraging grounds and roosting and maternity sites, or alter key micro-climates needed by the species. Additionally, loss of natural habitat around roost sites through poor land-use management practices, (such as inappropriate burning regimes, overgrazing and alteration of vegetation structure negatively affect foraging areas and prey base), land development activities including agricultural intensification (Driver et al. 2012), and alien invasive plant infestations are causing a decline in available habitat for foraging.Climate change may also influence micro-climate distribution. This species is very dependent on suitable subterranean environments for roosting and maternity requirements and associated natural habitats for foraging.

Recent field surveys in Guangxi and Guangdong provinces generated very few records of wild animals (Lau et al. 2010, M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2006). Elsewhere in its Chinese range it remains widespread and locally common, at least in sparsely (human-)populated areas. It is evidently not dependent on good-quality forest, with some records coming from low-intensity agricultural landscapes, although it is likely that hunting prevents occupation of a much larger area of non-forest land than is at present inhabited (Bosco P.L.

Numbers are probably restrained in Lao PDR and Viet Nam by the very heavy hunting typical in areas used by people, but even so the species is still seen occasionally in the suburbs of big towns (Duckworth et al. 2010). It is also hunted in the agricultural parts of Thailand with various videos of hunts available on You-tube (W. Chutipong pers. comm. 2014). The numbers traded in Medan, Sumatra (Shepherd et al. 2004), are large for the apparently small occupied area of the island, but the enormous markets for pets etc. in Java apparently trade rather few (Shepherd 2012). Habitat changes across the region are likely to have benefited the species strongly over the past century, with large-scale fragmentation, degradation and outright conversion of closed evergreen forest into habitats used by this species. Although the species has not been recorded from heavily urbanised areas (i.e. with no significant garden or parkland component) such habitats still comprise a negligible proportion of its range. The high overlap of its range with agriculture exposes it to the risk of chemical threats with the ever-changing variety of agrochemicals in use. In addition, whilst it is well recorded from unintensified agriculture and agriculture close to scrub and other (at least temporarily) uncultivated areas, its ability to use large landscapes dominated by intensified wet rice production is not well known (other than that it does occur in them).

Based on Lao PDR, extirpation, or decline to densities making detections extremely unlikely, seems to have proceeded faster in areas with marked dry seasons than in mountain evergreen forests with a more benign dry season, presumably because starting populations were higher in the latter habitats than in the former (see 'Habitats and ecology'). In Viet Nam, trade-driven hunting rose to industrial levels a decade or so earlier than in Lao PDR. The low number of camera-trap survey areas in Viet Nam with records of the species indicate that even in the presumed optimal habitats of evergreen forest with only a mild dry season, steep declines and, presumably, extirpation can occur. To date, hunting is at much lower levels in the rest of this species's range. In Lao PDR and Vietnam, much hunting involves metal cable snares set in long lines linked by drift fences, an approach very effective in catching ground-dwelling animals (e.g., Coudrat et al. 2014, Willcox et al. 2014); these snares are, mostly, big enough to secure Greater Hog Badger, because large ungulates are amongst the main targets. The geographical use of such snaring has expanded rapidly over the last 20 years and evidently continues to do so. In much of the species's range, most people entering forest and other natural habitat for whatever reason are accompanied by dogs, many have firearms, and most secure opportunistically any animal of hog badger size-class that they come across. Being partly diurnal, ground-dwelling and not prone to shyness, hog badgers must be particularly at risk to such opportunistic off-take.The threat which habitat change poses directly to this species is not clear. Indirectly, anything that opens up access to areas previously difficult to enter, in particular which allows vehicular removal of wildlife for sale, exacerbates the hunting threat. Almost all forms of habitat change by people co-occur with increased human access and presence, making the indirect threat from habitat change severe. Based on localities of specific records, it is unlikely that degraded and fragmented natural habitat are inherently unsuitable. These are not widely occupied probably because their higher densities of people, with concomitantly increased likelihood for badgers of lethal incidental encounters with people, prevent this. Outright conversion to entirely artificial habitat (agriculture, settlement and infrastructure) seems more likely to render an area unsuitable for Greater Hog Badger, but even this remains to be proven. Overall, the existence of large tracts of forest in the eastern parts of the species's range with at best low densities of this species indicate that there the chief threat is hunting. While perhaps this is not yet so in parts of the western range, it is increasingly likely to become so there, too.In Kaziranga National Park, India, numbers die in the periodic inundation of this flood-plain (Choudhury 2013). While formerly such animals might have been able to move safely to higher ground, the increasing fragmentation of natural habitat probably leads to higher mortalities nowadays. Nonetheless, in total these are likely to be insignificant to overall decline rates of the species, and are only a potential threat at the most local of levels.Hog badger hairs are used in European shaving brush manufacture (Domingo-Roura et al. 2006) but whether this species and wild populations are involved is unclear; the large farmed stock in China (Lau et al. 2010) seems a more likely origin.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Schmidt in 1971, these birch mice were widespread and probably common in the lowlands of the Carpathian basin. The species has become extinct in 98% of its former range due to increased use of rodenticides, loss of undisturbed areas, and increased reliance on mechanical activities for agricultural management.  The greatest threatening factor is the limited number of populations and the small geographic range  The Hungarian Birch Mouse was declared extinct in Austria, and possibly its status is the same in Slovakia and Serbia. Most of the known habitats lay within protected areas where the proper management is actually only guaranteed in a small part of the full “protected” area. Single area payment scheme (SAPS) of the European Union, which pays farmers for the land that they manage or own has stimulated the restructuring of the agricultural sector towards further simplification of production. For example, in Hungary, previously neglected or not intensively farmed areas are now more intensively utilized due to direct financial support; mechanical mowing is utilized more and more, which allows foliage treatment of large areas at once and reduces variability of vegetation, which in turn, can result in loss of associated flora. This situation is very unfavourable for the birch mice. Proportion of the area managed by mowing has been increased during the last 10 years thanks to the SAPS and to weed control management programs aim to confine allergen plants such as the ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia). Because of these activities and policies, the only known population of these birch mice in Hungary is declining at an alarming rate. The recommended habitat management method in the area inhabited by this lone population is low-intensity cattle grazing, but even so mechanical cutting or mowing take place; intensive sheep-farming is also typical and only an approximately 0.6 km2 (60 ha) area is designated unofficially as “Sicista Reserve.” The population of Transylvanian Birch Mouse (S. trizona transylvanica) is also threatened because the areas that provide ideal habitats are decreasing due to the spread of intensive agriculture and to the continued popularity of sheep farming. Meadows covered by tall and dense herbaceous vegetation, which are preferred by the birch mouse, are often ploughed up by local farmers or overgrazed by sheep.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

An important conservation measure needed for these primary habitats is to protect the poorly known fauna of this island (P-H Fabre pers. comm. 2017). In view of the lack of data concerning Halmahera island, more mammal fieldwork is required to have a better understanding of the distribution of this species. Another fieldwork on Halmahera Island (with 5 sampling localities) failed to detect this species (P-H Fabre pers. comm. 2017).

The fragmentation of highly suitable habitat causes isolation of subpopulations and often results in the remaining intact landscape become intersected by high speed roads. Many Maned Wolves are killed on roadways throughout its range. In central Brazil, road kills are a threat of major concern potentially leading to local extinction of small, isolated populations as estimates range from four to 10 individuals killed/year in some regions (Paula and Gambarini 2013, Rodrigues et al. 2014). Similar impact of vehicular collisions was detected in marginal populations from Argentina where 21 Maned Wolves were reported dead along National Route 34, concentrated between 2000 and 2005 (Orozco et al. 2013a). The same negative effect is potentially true in the humid Chaco of Paraguay where increased traffic on the Trans-Chaco highway leads to numerous road kills each year (A.J. Giordano pers. comm. 2015). Extreme climatic conditions such as uncontrolled fires and droughts are likely to exacerbate the scarcity of living resources and consequently the loss on roadways, as Maned Wolves are forced to travel farther for food and water (Pautasso et al. 2009, Orozco et al. 2013a); the latter is especially important during periods when females are lactating (Emmons 2014). Direct interactions with humans also pose a threat to the species. Conflicts with people, road mortality, the potential for infectious diseases spread by domestic dogs and direct persecution resulting from widely held superstitions and beliefs, are the primary threats facing Maned Wolves (Songsasen and Rodden 2010). In some areas of Argentina, Maned Wolves are persecuted with hunting, trapping, and shooting due to a mix of long-standing cultural beliefs, general ignorance of the species, and trophy hunting (Orozco et al. 2009, Orozco et al. 2013a, Soler 2014). In southeastern Santiago del Estero (Argentina), 30 Maned Wolves were reported sold to game ranches in a 10-year period (Orozco et al. 2013a). In Brazil and Paraguay, this targeted persecution of Maned Wolves extends beyond the traditional and natural medicine needs to include the low public tolerance of poultry depredation, for which Maned Wolves are constantly blamed (Paula et al. 2013, Cartes et al. 2014, A.J. Giordano pers. comm. 2015). In some areas this hunting pressure is so high it is having a significant negative effect on local Maned Wolf numbers (Paula et al. 2013). While illegal trade is not common, Orozco et al. (2009) found it was widespread in Argentina, and even included the sale of young animals or pups to private zoos and collections. Of the Maned Wolves kept in captivity in Argentina during the last five years 68% were wild born and came from/were victims of illegal trade, road collisions or were orphaned after their mother was killed (P. Gonzalez Ciccia pers. comm. 2015).Domestic dogs pose a serious threat to Maned Wolves on several levels, as often times domestic dogs accompany humans into the field for recreation and hunting. In addition, both Maned Wolves and dogs overlap in their use of habitat that has been converted to agriculture and pasture. Dogs are known to pursue Maned Wolves, which often results in the killing of the animal (Soler et al. 2005, Pautasso et al. 2009, Orozco et al. 2013a, Soler 2014, A.J. Giordano pers. comm. 2015). In a study carried out in Argentina, 26% of sightings by local villagers involved close contact between Maned Wolves and domestic dogs (Orozco et al. 2013a). Dogs are also a source of infectious diseases and parasites. However the epidemiological effects remain unclear for Maned Wolf conservation. Rural domestic dog populations in Argentina had very high seroprevalence for Neospora caninum, canine coronavirus, canine adenovirus, Dirofilara immitis, canine distemper virus, Toxoplasma gondii, and L. interrogans spp. In the same area, all of these agents (except N. caninum, Toxoplasma gondii and CCV) were serologically positive in local Maned Wolves (Orozco et al. 2013a). In a Bolivian population, Maned Wolves were serologically positive for two domestic dog pathogens (morbillivirus and parvovirus) that can cause pup mortality and high levels of potentially fatal (Dirofilara immitis) and debilitating (Dioctophyme renale) parasites were detected (Deem and Emmons 2005, Bronson et al. 2008, Deem et al. 2012, Emmons 2014). In Brazil, Maned Wolves were serologically positive for several dog-related infectious diseases including parvovirus, canine distemper virus, coronavirus, and leishmaniosis (Paula et al. 2014). These data from Bolivia, Brazil and Argentina suggest that other wild populations are at risk in areas where domestic dogs are present (May Jr and Felippe 2014). The frequent use of dogs for herding and hunting, along with their frequent foraging in natural habitats, could favour direct or indirect transmission of multiple pathogens (Orozco et al. 2013a).",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Hunting rates were highest in non-degraded forest and were positively associated with Fosa occupancy, meaning that hunters appear to be focusing their efforts in non-degraded forest where Fosa is most abundant. Golden et al (in press) report four Fosas hunted in one year at Betampona Strict Nature Reverve, two hunted opportunistically (presumably with dogs). Household interviews conducted by Madagasikara Voakajy (pers. comm. 2014) in the Moramanga region of eastern Madagascar between 2008 and 2009 suggest that 325 (21%) of 1,535 respondents interviewed in 129 villages had eaten Fosa in the preceding year.  Hunting is presumed to have increased significantly in many parts of the  species' range since 2009 because of less effective governance and  increased social instability following a coup d'etat. Deforestation and forest disturbance across the range of the Fosa has increased significantly since 2009. R. Rajaonson (pers. comm. 2014) estimates that deforestation in eastern forest increased from 0.5% per annum in 2005-2010 to 0.94% per annum in 2010-2013. Allnut et al. (2009) estimated that in Masoala National Park, annual rates of deforestation in the studied area increased to 1.27% per annum in 2011. High levels of illegal settlement in protected areas, especially around the Bay of d'Antongil, are linked to artisanal mining (for quartz) and logging of rosewood; hunting for food using dogs has increased greatly in these areas as a result. Some villages have seen increases in populations of between 200 and 300% (C. Golden pers. comm. 2014). Around Ranomafana National Park, Fosa is absent from forest fragments more than 15 km from core habitat and is about equally often detected in degraded and primary habitats (Gerber et al. 2012)In western Madagascar, Zinner et al. (2014) showed that for central Menabe, one of the most important centres of Fosa distribution, deforestation rates of 0.78 km2/yr in 2003-2006 increased to 1.09 km2/yr in 2006-2008, and to 2.55 km2/yr by 2008-2010. There is ample evidence that the increase continued in 2010-2014, coupled with increased illegal logging and hunting in the core forest areas, which will undoubtedly negatively effect populations of all native carnivores, especially through the increased presence of dogs. The Fosa also preys on domestic fowl and is consequently killed as a pest by local people. It seems very susceptible to hunting, and is often targeted by groups engaged in collective group hunting (e.g. in the Makira forests) specifically for the purpose of eradication. Its parts are used for medicinal purposes. Competition with introduced carnivores occurs, including predation by feral dog packs. The Fosa seems to be more nocturnal when in the same areas as highly active diurnal people and dogs. High nocturnal activity overlaps with activity of both Small Indian Civet Viverricula indica and feral/wild cats, revealing the potential for increased interactions and competition (Farris et al. in review b).Many camera-trap photographs of Fosas show animals carrying nooses from make-shift traps, and many show individuals with numerous scars and missing body parts (ears, lips, tails) which reportedly result from locals trying to kill them with machetes when they raid their livestock.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The Oman Arabian Oryx Sanctuary population was devastated by illegal live capture for sale to private collections and was rendered totally ineffective, with poachers removing or killing at least 200 Oryx in three years (Spalton et al. 1999). In fact, the site is the first ever to be deleted from UNESCO's world heritage list, based on Oman's decision to reduce the size of the protected area by 90% and to proceed with hydrocarbon prospection (UNESCO World Heritage Centre 2015). Some poaching has also been recorded in Uruq Bani Ma’arid in Saudi Arabia. Other populations in protected areas are generally safe from poaching but the security of animals that wander outside release sites cannot be guaranteed, except perhaps in Israel. Drought and overgrazing have reduced habitat quality in places and limited the choice of potential release sites. Prolonged drought in west-central Saudi Arabia resulted in the death of  560 Oryx in the fenced Mahazt as Sayd reserve, 1999-2008 (Islam et al.  2010, 2011).",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In the past its numbers and its distribution declined significantly due to the expansion of human activities in Southern Africa during the 19th and 20th centuries. Yet, in the last two decades there has been widespread reintroduction of Gemsbok to private land and protected areas, For example, in Namibia the largest numbers occur on private farmland, where the estimated population increased from 55,000 in 1972 to >164,000 in 1992 (East 1999). Despite this favourable trend, in some areas such as south-western Botswana its distribution is increasingly restricted to protected areas, to the point where there are now two discrete concentration areas within this region, in Central Kgalagadi-Khutse Game Reserves and within and to the north and east of Gemsbok National Park. Outside these protected areas, it occurs mainly in areas of the Kalahari without cattle (East 1999).Its ability to meet its survival needs within a relatively small area of semi-arid or arid savanna, even during severe droughts, enable it to occupy much smaller mean annual ranges than migratory species such as blue wildebeest and red hartebeest. The Gemsbok’s independence of surface water and non-migratory behaviour have enabled it to largely escape the adverse effects of veterinary cordon fencing (East 1999).",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

Rainfall has declined and continues to decline throughout the south west of Australia. T2014 and 2015 have been the, or close to the, driest on record near Albany. Albany mean rainfall (1877 to 2014): 929 mm; 2014: 638 (no data from December, mean is 30 mm, if 30 mm added = 668 mm); 2015: 621 mm (lowest on record). Busselton mean (1877 to 2014): 813.6 mm; 2014: 591 mm; 2015: 568 mm. Western Ringtail Possums ‘are among the species most likely to be impacted by predicted climate change in the south-west because they have very specific habitat and dietary requirements, have a poor ability to migrate and have lost large areas of habitat. In addition they are sensitive to drought-induced stress. Over the past 30 years there has been an approximate 20 per cent decline in rainfall in the south-west of WA, with more reductions in rainfall and increased temperatures predicted due to global climate change (Timbal 2004). These changes could result in further contraction of the species to the most fertile and mesic remnants of their extant range (Wayne 2005, Jones and Francesconi 2007)’ (Recovery Plan p. 10). Almost all remaining occurrences are associated with older-growth Peppermint, but few stands now seem to provide suitable nutrition for the species to survive and recruit Increasing temperature. ‘Western Ringtail Possums are known to be susceptible to heat stress and can easily overheat at temperatures of 35°C (Yin 2006). Western Ringtail Possums have been observed to use evaporative cooling in hot weather by applying saliva to the forelimbs or panting (Jones et al. 1994b). Jones et al. (1994b) observed that in areas where dreys were used, Western Ringtail Possums went to the ground over several hot days. Western Ringtail Possums are the smallest of the specialist marsupial folivores indicating that they live close to the ecological and physiological limits of viability (B. Jones pers. comm. 2002)’ (Recovery Plan pp. 6-7). As well, increasing temperatures exacerbate soil moisture reduction and further affect the nutritional quality of food.Land clearing. Land clearing for urban development remains a threat in the Busselton – Augusta near coastal strip and near Albany. Land clearing continues despite application of the EPBC Act guidelines that aim to assist in determining whether a proposed action is likely to have a significant impact on the Western Ringtail Possum on the southern Swan Coastal Plain. Most remaining habitat is on private land; thus the major land management is via planning controls, not via biodiversity legislation.Feral predators. Translocation experiments in the past and other data demonstrate that Red Foxes and feral Cats are major threats, especially where the canopy becomes more open due to ‘parkland clearing’ and after fire. Native predators also impact the species.Fire. Fire reduces food availability and opens up the canopy causing ringtails to spend more time on the ground where they can be predated by foxes and cats.Tree decline and insect outbreaks. Coastal Peppermint decline, gum leaf skeletoniser and Phytophthora dieback in Jarrah, Tuart decline and other tree declines have resulted in extensive but mainly localised reductions in food and habitat quality.Competition for tree hollows. Increased numbers of Brushtail Possums where fox baiting occurs leads to competition for hollows: brushtails are more aggressive and will evict ringtails. Hollow loss is also caused by logging and feral bees.Logging. Western Ringtail Possums are more abundant in unlogged forest or where logging has been least intense; logging leads to local mortality including via increased feral Cat predation. However, current WRP distribution does not now significantly overlap areas to be logged to a significant degree.Domestic dogs. ‘In urban environments predation or injury by domestic dogs can be frequent (de Tores et al. 1998). High levels of dog ownership within the City of Busselton create dog densities at four to eight times greater per hectare than the average fox density in the south-west forests (K. Williams pers. comm. 2006)’ (Recovery Plan, p.8). Ravens are a threat in urban areas where their numbers have increased.A plausible future threat is myrtle rust, which significantly affects peppermint (Agonis flexuosa), in eastern Australia where it is planted horticulturally, noting that peppermint is now the main habitat and food tree for WRPs.

Climate change is a threat to the species, with winter rainfall in south-western Australia having declined by ca 20% in past three decades, with decline likely to continue (Cleugh et al. 2011).

It is listed as a game species under Malagasy law and can be legally hunted between May and August (Durbin 2007). Only the few roosts that are located in protected areas therefore receive some protection (Racey et al. 2009). Pteropus rufus is hunted across Madagascar (MacKinnon et al. 2003, Rakotondravony 2006, Rakotonandrasana and Goodman 2007, Racey et al. 2009) where it is an important subsistence food but also of commercial importance. Investigations in eastern Madagascar revealed that people in urban areas are twice as likely to eat this species than those in rural areas: over 40% of the people interviewed in urban areas had eaten P. rufus compared with only 20% in rural areas (Jenkins et al. 2011). This proportion goes up to 60% in western Madagascar, with rural and urban areas combined (Razafimanahaka et al. 2012). Although quantitative data on the supply of P. rufus for food and the impact of this harvest on colonies/populations is scarce, there is some evidence that the offtake is locally unsustainable (Racey et al. 2009).Hunting occurs at roost sites and where the bats forage, especially when they feed on trees in villages (Jenkins and Racey 2008). A study during the austral winter in the western Madagascar town of Mahabo revealed that seven active hunters can kill 381 bats over a period of 43 days, with average of almost 4 bats a night. Over 80% of their catch is sold to the public . Hunters usually operate for around 90 days a year. There are up to 30 active hunters in Mahabo alone, so they could potentially account for 9,000 bats during 90 days of active hunting a year (Oleksy 2010). There is also evidence that P. rufus from Ile Sainte Marie is hunted commercially and frozen shipments are sent to the mainland port of Toamasina (Rakotonandrasana and Goodman 2007). The conversion of the forest used by roosting bats into agriculture is another threat to P. rufus and results in the permanent loss of suitable trees which in many cases have been used for decades. Pteropus rufus feeds on a number of cultivated fruits that have a high economic value in rural Madagascar and is often subjected to persecution.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

""are particularly vulnerable to the destruction of their aquatic habitats through pollution and drainage."" Activities such as logging, agriculture, road building, and surface mining contribute to the loss of habitat. Logging may not be a serious threat if water quality is protected and buffer strips are maintained at the site (Christian pers. comm., 1994). Regarding the subspecies S. p. punctulatus in the east, Pagels et al. (1991) stated: ""Perhaps the greatest continuing threats to the water shrew are the loss of additional habitat resulting from infestation of introduced insect species, such as the gypsy moth, or the use of insecticides to control such infestations. The effects of acid rain, particularly on the shrew's microhabitat and food supply could be particularly devastating"".Shrews feeding on invertebrates accumulate and concentrate pesticides and heavy metals in their tissues. Northern short-tailed shrews (Blarina brevicauda) were found to contain DDT nine years after application of the pesticide to a forest habitat (Dimond and Sherburne 1969). ""Contamination of habitats, and the resultant effects on the food chain, by mining and refining of metalliferous ores, by motor exhausts and even by the application of sewage sludge to land, is becoming more widespread. Shrews from contaminated grasslands have been found to accumulate some of the highest concentrations of metals recorded in wildlife"" (Churchfield 1992). Southern populations are limited to the mountains in both the east and west and consequently tend to be isolated.

Over-hunting, range degradation from livestock overgrazing, and interspecific competition for forage have all played significant and long-time roles in the demise of Guanacos all across their distributional range (Raedeke 1979; Franklin 1982; Miller et al. 1983; Cunazza et al. 1995; Cuellar and Fuentes 2000; Puig et al. 2001; Baldi et al. 2001, 2004). Currently, the main threats are still widespread, but mining and energy projects are also becoming a factor. Of special concern is the recent and rapid development of unconventional oil and gas exploration across large areas of the Guanaco’s distribution.In Peru Guanacos are seriously affected by poaching and subsistence hunting. Habitat degradation due to extractive industries and livestock overgrazing has been identified as major threats for the few remaining subpopulations (Wildlife Conservation Society 2012).In Bolivia the current major threat is habitat loss due to overgrazing by livestock. Although sport hunting was halted in 2001 (Cuéllar, unpublished data), poaching is still common.In Chile and Argentina, recreational hunting and poaching are major threats. In northern Chile at the local level, feral dogs are reducing Guanaco populations within and outside protected areas, and hybridism with Llamas is common in areas with low Guanaco densities. Mining and oil extraction along with photovoltaic and wind parks have expanded with the demand for increased production, resulting in habitat loss and fragmentation of populations in both countries.  In addition, in northern Chile and the Argentine Patagonia infrastructure development has caused road kills and entrapment within barriers lining highways causing local isolation and limiting population movements (Rey et al. 2012). Finally, in Chile and Argentina where numbers have recovered due to government sponsored management programs and Guanaco populations coexist with ranching and forestry practices, there has been a return to public resentment towards Guanacos as occurred in historical times. Demonstrated-sustained programs of Guanacos utilization that benefit the local economy and lower population numbers are needed if Guanaco are to be maintained.Health studies conducted in mainland Patagonia have shown that Guanaco populations are relatively disease-free, but susceptible to common diseases from domestic sheep, cattle, and horses (Karesh et al. 1998, Beldomenico et al. 2003, Uhart et al. unpub. data). Castillo (2006) came to a similar conclusion based upon studies of parasite load in free ranging Peruvian Guanacos. Recently, scabies has been reported to affect Guanacos in northern Chile causing mortality in low-density populations. It is also a common disease in Guanacos inhabiting Tierra del Fuego, Chile (Skewes pers. comm.).Today the Guanaco occupies only 26% of its original range (calculated by Ceballos and Ehrlich 2002, based upon Franklin 1982). Specifically, range distribution has been reduced by 58% in Argentina, 75% in Chile, and over 90% in Perú, Bolivia, and Paraguay (Cunazza et al. 1995, Ceballos and Ehrlich 2002). Moreover, distribution has become fragmented into smaller, relatively isolated populations. Although the species is not threatened with demographic extinction at a continental scale, it is predicted that the northern subspecies L. guanicoe cacsilensis will become extinct in Peru within 30 years if current-hunting mortality rates are not curtailed (www.conopa.org). Guanacos are ecologically extinct in most of their remaining range (Novaro et al. 2000), with some southern populations at serious risk of local or even regional extirpation (Cunazza et al. 1995). Spatial fragmentation in general is a threat to Guanaco populations (Wildlife Conservation Society 2012). Recent findings suggest that inbreeding or aberrant mutations may lead to reproductive failure and congenital malformations (Franklin and Grigione 2005, Zapata et al. 2008, González et al. 2014).Increasing pressure from private landowners in Patagonian rangelands may result in a threat to the remaining high-density Guanaco populations if management is not properly planned and implemented. Live-shearing and subsequent release of wild Guanacos could contribute to their conservation only if the effects of this activity are properly assessed and management is applied accordingly. If not ecologically sustainable, the viability of the most important Guanaco populations will be at risk. Careful evaluation of current management practices involving live shearing is currently in progress, but a long-term assessment is necessary. For Guanaco populations under a hunting strategy of use, information about habitat preferences, flight distance, individual and population movement, group composition, and the effect on neighbouring populations are urgently needed for proper assessment of this kind of productive system.Land desertification due to overgrazing coupled with more severe and frequent droughts caused by climate change/variation are potential threats of great concern to Guanaco abundance throughout its range. Severe droughts can have drastic effects on local Guanaco populations as documented in eastern Patagonia (Baldi et al. 2010). In addition, models on climate change predict a sharp decrease in rain precipitation within the next 50 years in arid-southern South America (Nohara et al. 2006). Therefore, it is crucial to favor the ecological functionality of Guanaco populations through adequate management as a step to mitigate additional effects of climate change. ",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

The natural spatial and temporal dynamics of the tall grassland habitat, particularly the fire cycles, are key important to the conservation of this species (Bell et al. 1990, Maheswaran 2002, Yadav et al. 2008, Aryal et al. 2012, Tandan et al. 2013, Nath and Machary 2015, Nidup, Dorji and Jamphel 2015). The natural process of succession of grassland into woodlands reduces suitable habitat for grassland specialists such as the Hispid Hare. Thus, the elephant grass habitat occupied by the species is highly fragmented, and often intersected by forests, streams, and rivers (Maheswaran 2002). It has been estimated that a decline (quantitative and qualitative) of 20-50% in suitable habitat occurred between 1994 and 2005, a rate that was expected to continue through 2014 (Jordan et al. 2005). Recent literature indicates that the destruction of habitat has continued (Yadav et al. 2008, Aryal et al. 2012, Tandan et al. 2013, Nath and Machary 2015, Nidup, Dorji and Jamphel 2015).

In particular, the effects of the current high levels of forest degradation within much of its range cannot be assumed to be strongly negative, given the number of records from degraded and fragmented areas. Similarly, although much of its range coincides with heavy generalised mammal hunting using non-specific techniques, there is no evidence that this (or the inevitable retaliatory killing for actual or perceived losses of small livestock such as poultry) is driving steep declines over any large proportion of its range. This does not mean that such declines might not be occurring locally; this is most likely to be so in Viet Nam, looking at patterns of ground-level snaring pressure. Even in this case, the paucity of salvage records from snare lines suggests that weasels are only rarely caught: plausibly they move through the brush-wood drift fences (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014) and, given that the snare-lines usually run across relatively open understorey, weasels perhaps avoid these areas anyway (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014).

Hunting is now likely to be less of a problem than formerly except at a local scale, whereas agrochmicals and introduced carnivores may be widespread and increasing threats (see below).Wetland destruction has been identified as a cause of decline in Germany and Switzerland (A. Schreiber pers. comm. 2015, P. Dollinger pers. comm. 2015). In areas where the Polecat is associated with wetlands, reduction of these habitats is particularly damaging in autumn and winter, during periods of lower abundance of amphibians (Weber 1989, Lodé 1991, Baghli et al. 2002). In France, the drying of wetlands and the increase of agricultural land more than halved the total wetland area between 1940 and 1990 (Report Claude Bernard 1994). Hedges provide adequate cover for Polecat activity in otherwise open farmland (Birks 2000). Consequently, the wide destruction of hedgerows that occurred in western Europe in the mid and late 20th century is likely to have contributed to the decline of the species. Indeed, despite a slowdown in the uprooting of hedgerows since the 1990s, hedgerow surface area declined by 5% per year in France from 1982 to 1990 (Pointereau 2002).Reduced prey-base also causes some declines, particularly in Mediterranean areas where European Rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus forms a large part of the diet (see 'Habitats and ecology' section). Mediterranean Rabbit populations have been in steep decline for 25 years because of diseases, such as myxomatosis (Calvete et al. 1997) and rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) (Moreno et al. 2007, Delibes-Mateos et al. 2009), and modification of its habitat and hunting (Calvete et al. 2006). The steep declines in Switzerland up to the 1970s were attributed in part to declining populations of amphibians (P. Dollinger pers. comm. 2015). Declines in other prey species, such as European Hamster Cricetus cricetus and even rats and mice (Muridae) probably contribute to the steep declines in parts of the range such as Saxony-Anhalt, Germany (A. Weber pers. comm. 2015). Such declines are driven by intensive agriculture (high pesticide use, rapid cultivation, choice of crops and the near-complete use of land.Western Polecat is vulnerable to heavy trapping. It disappeared from most of Britain because of sustained intensive trapping, as a pest of game-birds and small livestock, from the 19th century into the early decades of the 20th (Langley and Yalden 1977). However, it recolonised the country following the near-cessation of this practice (Birks and Kitchener 1999, Birks 2000) and the resurgence of Rabbit populations (Birks 2000).In western Europe, Western Polecat was formerly widely hunted for sport and fur and persecuted as a pest, but these threats have become less serious. The species is now protected in a number of range states and in such areas, the rates of hunting have greatly reduced. For example, in Switzerland, in each of the years 2009, 2013 and 2014 only a single individual (male) was killed under special license. Cantons issuing the licenses were Zurich, Berne and Argovia (P. Dollinger pers. comm. 2016). In such areas, legal killing cannot be a threat. In France, Western Polecat was classified as 'pest' in half of (49) French departments in 1997, 1999 and 2001. But trapping of Polecats has progressively decreased since 1998, and has not been permitted since 2012 (Albaret et al. 2014), except in two areas (totalling around 3,500 km²). However, even before the ban, trapping intensity seemed limited: in 1998, catches were performed in only 8.6% (± 14%) of localities where the species could legally be trapped (Ruette et al. 2004), and only around 6,000 catches by trapping were registered in France in 2011 (Albaret  et al. 2014). August 2012 modification of the French legislation about 'pest' species meant that the Polecat could not be trapped until July 2015; subsequent legislation (July 2015 to July 2018) does not permit trapping of Polecats except in two areas. However, legal trapping for other mustelid species and non-selective predator control (see Treves and Naughton-Treves, 2005) could represent a threat for the Polecat (S. Ruette and M. Guinot-Ghestem pers. comm. 2015). In particular, trapping campaigns against the American Mink Neovison vison have resulted in many Polecats being killed in confusion (C. Arthur pers. comm. 2016). Hunting Western Polecat with guns remains legally permitted in France. The 2013 national enquiry estimated that fewer than 3,000 Polecats were hunted in 2013 in France (ONCFS-FNC in press).Hunting, as a perceived pest of wild game, is legal throughout the year in Austria (A. Kranz pers. comm. 2016).By contrast with much of western Europe, in European Russia the species is still hunted. However, intentional hunting is not intensive because the price per pelt is so cheap: only 30–50% of that of American Mink and 10–20% that of martens Martes. In the area of best habitat for the species in Russia, the southern forest expanses in the European part, the polecat is hunted intentionally only occasionally, for example as a pest of domestic animals such as chickens (D. Skumatov pers. comm. 2015). Harvest usually occurs as a 'by-catch'of hunting for American Mink and Pine Marten Martes martes (A. Vaisman per R. Melisch, pers. comm. 2016). The species is fairly frequent by-catch in traps set for American Mink, but only rarely in the baited leghold traps set for martens, beavers Castor, Red Fox Vulpes vulpes, badgers Meles, Musk Rat Ondatra zibethicus, Eurasian Lynx Lynx lynx and others (D. Skumatov pers. comm. 2015). In one area, the trapping of 4,000 Pine Martens resulted in only about 100 Western Polecats taken as bycatch (A. Saveljev pers. comm. 2016). Overall, trapping is not a threat to the species in Russia (A. Saveljev pers. comm. 2016). In Morocco and Algeria, in at least some areas, the species is captured for hunting (e.g. Ahmim 2013).In Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, Polecats have a very high pollutant burden (PCB, PBB, PBDE, OCP and human medicine) leading to diminished reproductive output (which is particularly problematic for 'r-strategy' species such as this) (A. Weber pers. comm. 2015). There is too little comparable information from other parts of the species's range, but there is no reason not to think that similar pollutant loads will not be borne by populations elsewhere in lowland mesic western and central Europe, given patterns of human settlement and agriculture. Frogs sampled in Switzerland in the 1980s had high levels of PCBs and these pollutants were considered to have led to major declines in the country's Eurasian Otter Lutra lutra populations (Weber 1990); subsequently otter populations have strengthened in the country (P. Dollinger pers. comm. 2016); Polecat numbers have risen at the same time although the cause is not known. Secondary rodenticide poisoning (see Shore et al. 1996, 1999, 2003; Birks 1998; Fournier-Chambrillon et al. 2004; Giraudoux 2006) could potentially be an important threat, but its impact on Polecat populations remains to be evaluated extensively.The introduced American Mink is likely to be a problematic, at some level, for the Polecat in the large parts of its range where this invasive species is now established. The long-term population-level consequences on the Polecat of the variety of effects of this species (see, e.g. Barrientos 2015) remain poorly understood. Three carnivore species are believed to be driving Polecat declines in Belarus: the introduced American Mink in valley ecosystems (competition for prey during raising kits, especially the decline in Water Voles Arvicola amphibius effected by American Mink, and interference towards vulnerable female Polecats); the introduced Raccoon Dog Nyctereutes procyonoides, mainly in forest–swamp mosaics (competition for carrion in late winter); and the Beech Marten Martes foina (interference in human settlements and their surroundings) (Sidorovich 2011, V.E. Sidorovich pers. comm. 2016). In Latvia the species is possibly being displaced from some areas around human settlement by Beech Marten (J. Ozolins pers. comm. 2015).The extent to which hybridisation threatens populations is unclear. Hybridisation with wild-living Domestic Ferrets Mustela furo occurs in the United Kingdom (Costa et al. 2013) but it seems unlikely that on the mainland populations will in the long-term depart phenotypically from wild-type Polecats. In Britain feral Ferrets generally only thrive on islands and appear to be unable to withstand competition from M. putorius (A. Kitchener pers. comm. 2015). In Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, introgression with Domestic Ferret was found in 6% of 34 individuals tested genetically, and in 10% of 104 checked morphologically (for skull constriction) (A. Weber pers. comm. 2016). Overall, the zone of sympatry between Western Polecat and Steppe Polecat M. eversmanii includes 43% of the former's distribution area and 20% of the latter's (Ternovski and Ternovskaya 1994). Wild-taken hybrids are held in museums of Ukraine, Belarus, and also in the Rostov-on-Don and Orel cities (Russia) (Ternivski and Ternovskaya 1994). The sympatry is not the result of recent range expansion, suggesting that such hybridisation is unlikely to be a threat to the species. Hybridisation also occurs with European Mink M. lutreola, but again this seems unlikely to be a threat to this species.Mustelids are described as vulnerable to accidental mortality from road traffic (Birks 1993) and the widespread steep increase of road traffic in western Europe and increasingly elsewhere in the species' range might have population-level effects in areas of high road density. Moreover, the presence of Polecat prey on and near road-verges may also increase its traffic collision mortality of the predator (Birks 1993, Barrientos and Bolonio 2008).",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Ongoing habitat degradation and conversion is continually reducing the potential population, should hunting be brought under control (Duckworth et al. 1999, Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Timmins and Ou 2001, Choudhury 2002, Steinmetz 2004, Than Zaw pers. comm. 2006, R.J Timmins pers. comm. 2008, F. Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008). Hunting is often for meat and a variety of methods are used (Choudhury 2002). There is also a flourishing international trade in Gaur parts, both horns (decorative) and internal organs (for medicinal purposes). Given the small size of the remaining Southeast Asian subpopulations and the number of trophies found for sale in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Myanmar during essentially opportunistic surveys, trade is clearly a major threat (Srikosamatara et al. 1992; Baird 1993; Srikosamatara and Suteethorn 1994, 1995; Martin and Phipps 1996; Srifa La-Ong et al. 1997; Duckworth et al. 1999). The most important population in Cambodia is scattered through a forest landscape that encompasses four provinces (Mondulkiri, Kratie, Stung Treng and Ratanakiri) and five conservation areas (Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area, Mondulkiri Protection Forest (including the Srepok Wilderness area) and Phnom Nam Lyr Wildlife Sanctuary). Hunting is still rife in much of this area, and forest fragmentation is rapidly accelerating with human population immigration, infrastructural developments (especially roads), commercial agricultural expansion, economic land speculation and mineral extraction. However, although perhaps less than 20% of this area is well protected from the aforementioned threats and protected area management is only close to effective in two areas, the most significant constraint to the area’s Gaur is the long-term uncertainty of continuation of effective conservation management of the Srepok Wilderness Area and Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area. Although conservation efforts for Gaur and many other species are, in both these areas, extremely encouraging, both face an uncertain future with the possibility of degazettement of conservation status of parts of them, the possible loss of adequate external funding necessary to maintain high standards of management, the possible loss of political support necessary to uphold high protection standards and the uncertainties of maintaining a motivated well trained staff. Almost throughout Southeast Asia, protected areas are not yet stalling declines in mammals with commercial value, such as Gaur. Areas with stabilized populations (in addition to the two Cambodian areas, perhaps only a few areas in Thailand (see Population) and Cat Tien National Park in Viet Nam) are exceptional (R. Steimetz pers. comm. 2008, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008).Surprisingly, given its retention of healthy populations of other high-value very large mammals (Tiger and Asian Elephant (Elephas maximus); Lynam et al. 2007; S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008 for elephants), Malaysia has among the most rapidly declining populations of Gaur. This reflects targeted hunting for large mammals of high commercial value, even within protected areas (Abdul Kadir 1998, Wan Shahruddin 1998, Lynam 1999, DWNP/Danced 2002, Lynam et al. 2007). Given the rapid decline within the 1990s and the lack of information traced since 2002, the exact current situation of Gaur in Malaysia is unclear. Kemasul Forest Reserve, where the species was found in Laidlaw’s (2000) survey of virgin jungle reserves, probably no longer exists as such. Even at the time of survey, most of the Forest Reserve was due to be converted into an Acacia mangium plantation, although still nominally a Forest Reserve. Kemasul was, long ago, part of a massive block of lowland forest which included the famous Jengka Triangle and Krau ""Game"" Reserve. Only Krau remains, albeit much reduced (R. Dunlop pers. comm. 2008). Even Krau, which was set up (in 1923) principally for the protection of Gaur, numerous in the area then, faces multiple threats (R. Dunlop pers. comm. 2008). In the surveys for DWNP/DANCED (2002), evidence of hunting, including cartridges, was found within the reserve, particularly in the easily accessible lowland areas; there were plenty of hunting stories by and about all of the different local communities, without exception, although their preferred target species differed. Conversion from natural forest to other land-uses of adjacent state-land combined with new ease of access has undoubtedly made Krau more of a focal point for such activity. There is a new (metalled) road and land conversion right up to the boundaries, facilitating access and easing the use of hunting methods such as spotlighting, as well as reducing habitat. The salt licks (for which Krau used to be famous) increasingly fall outside the forest (reflecting shrinking reserve boundaries and farmland encroachment into the reserve) and are now mostly in zones of high human activity of one sort or another. Temporary grasslands generated through traditional indigenous farming, which were often fairly difficult to get to and thus relatively free from hunting, were previously important Gaur habitat. A forester who used to work in Malaysia in the 1940s said that Gaur herds used to follow the Orang Asli settlements, moving in when they moved out, and Weigum (1972) even recommended ""...to maintain herds in the park it is recommended that 45 acres of land be clear-cut preferably in 15 acre plots ½ mile apart and be recut every three years"". Gaur meat is, or at least was being, sold at restaurants in placed like Cameron and Grik.In south and central India, densities are likely to be widely below ecological carrying capacity, through hunting and competition with domestic livestock, although this conclusion is based on rather few empirical studies and there are some outstanding populations in well-secured protected areas. Substantial declines and local extinctions of Gaur were driven by hunting (for meat), competition with livestock, and habitat conversion, particularly during the first half of the twentieth century, resulting in a drastically reduced and fragmented distributional range, especially outside the protected area network (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Hunting is much less prevalent than in Southeast Asia, reflecting the general enforcement of wildlife protection laws (Farshid Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008). Nonetheless, even in high-profile reserves, it is still suppressing densities significantly. For example, densities in Bhadra Tiger Reserve are very low, because of poaching, by comparison with what the habitat should support (Jathanna et al. 2003), and the measured density in a heavily hunted area of Nagarahole National Park was only a third of that in a well secured area (Madhusudan and Karanth 2002). Even though all hunting is illegal in this protected area, preventive measures are uneven across it, and Gaur is still poached, at least sporadically, wherever protection effectiveness is low (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Gaur, has reportedly been exterminated from three Indian protected areas, Thattekad Wildlife Sanctuary (Kerala), Bhandhavgarh (Madhya Pradesh) and Kanger Valley National Park (Madhya Pradesh) (Pasha et al. 2004). Interaction with domestic stock is greatly under-appreciated as a threat to Gaur, but is probably the main factor which currently limits populations in south and central India: livestock are widely grazed even in otherwise well-managed protected areas. Mean densities of Gaur were fully 132 times higher in livestock-free areas than in adjacent livestock-grazed areas of Bandipur, and in shared grazing areas Gaur densities declined sharply with increasing livestock densities; in the grazed area studied, halving the livestock density allowed increases of Gaur by a factor of 57 (Madhusudan 2004). Threats to southern India’s forest ungulates by competition with domestic stock grazing within protected areas are exacerbated where dung is collected for export to adjacent coffee areas. Fuel wood removal may also be at levels sufficient to disrupt nutrient cycles of the habitat (Madhusudan 2005). Many Indian forest areas are severely encroached by exotics such as Lantana camara, Parthenium spp. and Chromolaena odorata, and these are suspected to effect major changes to forest structure (Hiremath and Sundaram 2005): but the effects of these on Gaur populations warrant further study. Killing of Gaur in retaliation to crop damage (through consumption and trampling) occurs, but is of limited significance to conservation (Choudhury 2002, Farshid Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008). Some animals also die from ingestion of agrochemicals, and human response when wandering into farmland and villages; these could be significant for already isolated and reduced populations (Choudhury 2002).Throughout the range, diseases, particularly rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease, transmitted by domestic cattle are a potentially serious threat. Foot-and-mouth is the most frequent, but rinderpest has had a particularly dramatic impact in India and several sub-populations of Gaur were nearly destroyed as a result of the disease in 1968 (Krishnan 1972, Pal and Guin 1986, Choudhury 2002), while in Bhadra, it nearly wiped out Gaur populations in 1988–1989, when nearly 800 individuals died (Girish D.V. pers. comm. 2008). In north and central Myanmar anthrax was a major factor in the decline of the species (Salter 1983). Pasha et al. (2004) considered that “in fact no wild animal in India [is] so profoundly influenced by transmitted infections from domestic livestock as Gaur”. There is little research or other evidence to determine impacts of introgression with domestic oxen on Gaur populations, although such factors might be expected to be most serious in India, given the wide overlap of domestic stock with Gaur. Farshid Ahrestani (pers. comm. 2008) saw a Gaur herd of 20 individuals far from human habitation with one domestic ox in the Palni Hills, so it seems likely that introgression occurs to at least some extent.Srikosamtara and Suteethorn (1995) drew attention to the pressing threats facing Gaur, placing it in the same league of trade-driven threat as better-known species such as Tiger and Asian Elephant, and emphasising the international dimension of trade. Subsequently, the population collapse in Malaysia seems to have been driven by hunting teams from Lao PDR and Thailand (as proven by language at hunting camps in Temenggor), co-opting local Malaysian associates (A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2008). It is reasonable to expect that when returns in Malaysia drop (as they probably have done already) these teams may turn their attention to other countries’ Gaur populations.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

It also may prove detrimental to their foraging habits in forested areas. Use of chemical and biological insecticides is another source of concern affecting their food supply. A less vital, yet very real threat to M. septentrionalis is the disturbance they face in the caves (where recreational ""caving"" is popular) or mines (which are often closed after being abandoned) where they hibernate. A solution to the problem of disturbance at hibernacula is to put up gates that permit the bats to pass while excluding humans (Thomas 1993).Recently, the white-nose syndrome (WNS) has become a major threat for this and other North American bats (Alves et al. 2014).
